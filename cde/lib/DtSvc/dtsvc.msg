$ 
$ There may be three types of messages in this file:
$ 
$  1. Messages that appear in dialogs or are displayed to the user.
$ 
$     These messages are the default and they should ALL BE LOCALIZED.
$     Note that these messages do NOT have any identification (see the
$     comments for type 2 and 3 below).
$ 
$  2. Messages that only appear in the DT error log file ($HOME/.dt/errorlog).
$ 
$     The localization of these messages is OPTIONAL.  These messages are
$     identified by the following:
$ 
$  MESSAGES xx-yy IN SET zz WILL ONLY APPEAR IN THE DT ERRORLOG FILE
$ 
$  3. Messages that should not be localized.  
$ 
$     These messages are identified by the following:
