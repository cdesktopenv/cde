/* $XConsortium: */

Introduction

   The purpose of this demo program is to show the use of some ToolTalk
   APIs.  In particular, this program creates and registers a pattern,
   creates a notification message and sends it (to itself) and receives
   a message.

Building and Running the Demo Program

   To build the demo program:

      % make -f Makefile.<PLATFORM>

	where <PLATFORM> is replaced with the name of your system's 
	platform type.

   To run the program:

      % broadcast

   When the "Broadcast" button is pressed, the program creates a
   notifcation message, increments a counter for the number of messages
   sent, sets the "Send" slider to the value of the counter and then
   sends the message.

   When the program receives a message, it updates the "Received"
   slider to the number of messages received.
