This directory contains various examples, modules and files for use with the
Common Desktop Environment Application Builder, specifically:

  README        - This file
  about_box.bil - A module (BIL) file that provides a standard CDE
		  application "About Box".  (This should be connected
		  to the "About <Application Name>..." item in your
		  application's Help menu.  To use this, start dtbuilder,
		  load your application (project), bring up the Import Module 
		  item from the File menu, and use the file selection box 
		  that appears to select and Import this file by copy.   
		  (You should then modify the imported version so it matches
		  your application.  See the CDE Style Guide for more details.)
