.TH VDELTA 3 "16 July 1994"
.SH NAME
vdelta \- data differencing and compression
.SH SYNOPSIS
.MW "#include <vdelta.h>"
.nf
.MW "long vddelta(Vddisc_t* source, Vddisc_t* target, Vddisc_t* delta, int window);"
.MW "long vdupdate(Vddisc_t* source, Vddisc_t* target, Vddisc_t* delta);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions embody an algorithm for determining a compressed form of the
difference between two byte streams,
and for applying that difference to a byte stream.
.PP
.I Vddelta
computes a transformation (encoded as the byte stream \f5delta\fP)
that maps the source byte stream \f5source\fP
to the target byte stream \f5target\fP.
If the source stream is empty (\f5source\fP is \f5NULL\fP or
\f5source->size\fP is non-positive),
\fIvddelta\fP acts like a compression routine.
\f5window\fP specifies the largest amount of data that
will be processed at one time.
Typically, larger values decrease the size of the transformation and increase
the time needed to calculate it.
A non-positive value for \f5window\fP indicates that \fIvddelta\fP
should pick some value at its convenience.
\fIVddelta\fP returns the length of the transformation byte stream.
.PP
.I Vdupdate
applies a transformation \f5delta\fP generated by
\fIvddelta\fP to the source byte stream \f5source\fP
and emits the target byte stream \f5target\fP.
\fIVdupdate\fP returns the length of the target byte stream.
.PP
The handling of data for a data stream is defined
by a discipline structure of type \f5Vddisc_t\fP.
This type contains the following members:
.in +.5i
.nf
.MW "long size;"
.MW "Void_t* data;"
.MW "int (*readf)(Void_t* buf, int n, long offset, Vddisc_t* disc);"
.MW "int (*writef)Void_t* buf, int n, long offset, Vddisc_t* disc);"
.fi
.in -.5i
.TP
\f5size\fP defines the length of the respective data stream.
.TP
\f5data\fP, if not \f5NULL\fP, is an array that either contains
the entire data for a read stream or is large enough to store
the entire generated data. For example, in the \fIvddelta\fP call,
\f5target->size\fP defines the length of the target stream.
In this case, if \f5target->data\fP is not \f5NULL\fP,
it is assumed to contain all of the target data
(therefore, \f5target->readf\fP is not required.)
.TP
.MW readf
points to a function that reads at most \f5n\fP bytes
into \f5buf\fP from position \f5offset\fP
in the byte stream specified by the  as described above, and
returns the number of bytes actually read, or \-1 on error.
The argument \f5disc\fP is the containing discipline structure.
.TP
.MW writef
is identical to \f5readf\fP except that it writes rather than reads bytes.
.TP
.PP
\f5Void_t\fP is \f5#define\fPd as \f5void\fP if possible, otherwise \f5char\fP.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Both
.I vddelta
and
.I vdupdate
return \-1 on error.
