				 ABSTRACT



       ksh-93 is a major rewrite of ksh, a program that serves as a
       command language (shell) for the  UNIX*	 operating  system.
       As  with  ksh,  ksh-93  is  essentially	compatible with the
       System V version of the Bourne  shell[1]  ,  and  compatible
       with previous versions of ksh.  ksh-93 is intended to comply
       with the IEEE POSIX 1003.2 shell standard and the ISO  9945-
       2[2] shell standard.  In addition to changes in the language
       required  by these standards, the primary focus of ksh-93 is
       related	to  shell   programming.    ksh-93   provides	the
       programming  power  of  several other interpretive languages
       such as awk[3], FIT[4], perl[5], and tcl[6].

       This memo assumes that the reader is already  familiar  with
       the  Bourne  shell.   It  introduces most of the features of
       ksh-93 relative to the  Bourne  shell;  both  as  a  command
       language  and  as  a  programming  language.   The  Appendix
       contains a sample script written in ksh-93.

       1.  INTRODUCTION

       The term "shell" is used to describe a program that provides
       a command language interface.   Because	the  UNIX*   system
       shell is a user level program, and not part of the operating
       system itself, anyone can write a new  shell  or  modify  an
       existing  one.	This has caused an evolutionary progress in
       the design and implementation of  shells,  with	the  better
       ones  surviving.   The  most  widely  available	UNIX system
       shells are the Bourne shell[7], written by Steve  Bourne  at
       AT&T Bell Laboratories, the C shell[8], written by Bill	Joy
       at the University of California, Berkeley, and the KornShell
       language  [9],  written	by  David   Korn   at	AT&T   Bell
       Laboratories.   The  Bourne shell is available on almost all
       versions of the UNIX system.  The C Shell is available  with
       all Berkeley Software Distribution, BSD, UNIX systems and on
       many other systems.  The KornShell, is available on System V
       Release	4  systems.  In  addition,  it is available on many
       other systems.  The source for  the  KornShell  language  is
       available  from	the  AT&T Toolchest, an electronic software
       distribution system.  It runs on all known versions  of	the
       UNIX system and on many UNIX system look-alikes.

       There have been several articles comparing the  UNIX  system
       shells.	 Jason	Levitt[10]  highlights	some  of  the	new

       features  introduced  by  the  KornShell   language.    Rich
       Bilancia[11] explains some of the advantages  of  using	the
       KornShell language.  John Sebes[12] provides a more detailed
       comparison  of  the three shells, both as a command language
       and as a programming language.

       The KornShell language is a superset of	the  Bourne  shell.
       The  KornShell  language  has  many  of	the popular C shell
       features, plus additional features of its own.  Its  initial
       popularity  stems  primarily  from  its	improvements  as  a
       command language.  The primary interactive  benefit  of	the
       KornShell  command  language is a visual command line editor
       that allows you to make corrections to your current  command
       line  or  to earlier command lines, without having to retype
       them.

       However, in  the  long  run,  the  power  of  the  KornShell
       language  as a high-level programming language, as described
       by Dolotta and  Mashey[13],  may  prove	to  be	of  greater
       significance.   ksh-93  provides  the  programming  power of
       several other interpretive languages such as awk, FIT, perl,
       and  tcl.  An application that was originally written in the
       C  programming  language  was  rewritten  in  the  KornShell
       language.   More  than  20,000 lines of C code were replaced
       with KornShell scripts totaling fewer than  700	lines.	 In
       most  instances	there  was  no	perceptible  difference  in
       performance between the two versions of the code.

       The KornShell language  has  been  embedded  into  windowing
       systems	allowing  graphical user interfaces to be developed
       in shell rather than having to build applications that  need
       to be compiled.	The wksh program[14], provides a method  of
       developing OpenLook or Motif applications as ksh scripts.

       This memo is an introduction  to  ksh-93  the  program  that
       implements  an  enhanced  version of the KornShell language.
       It is referred to as ksh in the rest of this memo.  The memo
       describes  the  KornShell  language based on the features of
       the 02/25/93 release of ksh.  This memo is not  a  tutorial,
       only  an  introduction.	The second edition of reference [9]
       gives a more complete treatment of the KornShell language.

       A concerted effort has been made to achieve  both  System  V
       Bourne  shell  compatibility and IEEE POSIX compatibility so
       that scripts written for either	of  these  shells  can	run
       without modification with ksh.  In addition, ksh-93 attempts

       to be compatible with older versions of ksh.  When conflicts
       between	these  versions  of  the  shell, ksh-93 selects the
       behavior  dictated  by  the  IEEE   POSIX   standard.	The
       description of features in this memo assumes that the reader
       is already familiar with the Bourne shell.


       2.  COMMAND LANGUAGE

       There is no separate command language.  All features of	the
       language,  except  job  control,  can  be used both within a
       script and interactively from a terminal.  However, features
       that  are  more	likely	to  be	used while running commands
       interactively from a terminal are presented here.

       2.1  Setting Options

       By convention, UNIX  commands  consist  of  a  command  name
       followed by options and other arguments.  Options are either
       of the form -letter, or -letter value.  In the former  case,
       several	options  may  be  grouped  after  a  single -.	The
       argument -- signifies an end to the option list and is  only
       required when the first non-option argument begins with a -.
       Most commands print  an	error  message	which  shows  which
       options	 are  permitted  when  given  incorrect  arguments.
       Ordinarily, ksh executes a command by using the command name
       to  locate  a program to run and by running the program as a
       separate process.  Some commands, referred to as  built-ins,
       are  carried  out by ksh itself, without creating a separate
       process.  The reasons that some commands  are  built-in	are
       presented  later.   In  nearly  all  cases  the	distinction
       between a command that is built-in and one that	is  not  is
       invisible  to  the  user.  However, nearly all commands that
       are built-in follow command line conventions.  In  addition,
       the  option  sequence -? causes the command to print a usage
       message which lists the valid options.

       ksh has several options that can  be  set  by  the  user  as
       command	line  arguments  and as option arguments to the set
       command.  Most options can  be  set  with  a  single  letter
       option  or  as a name that follows the -o option. Use set -o
       to display the  current	option	settings.   Some  of  these
       options,  such  as  interactive and monitor (See Job Control
       below) are enabled automatically by ksh when  the  shell  is
       connected  to  a  terminal  device.   Other options, such as
       noclobber and ignoreeof are normally  placed  in  a  startup

    written approval of the director of the distributing organization.

       file.   The  noclobber  option  causes ksh to print an error
       message when you use > to redirect to a	file  that  already
       exists,	If  you  want to redirect to an existing file, then
       you have to use >| to override the  noclobber  option.	The
       ignoreeof   option   is	used  to  prevent  the	end-of-file
       character, normally ^D(Control-d), from	exiting  the  shell
       and  possibly  logging  you  out.  You must type exit to log
       out.  Most of the options are  described  in  this  memo  as
       appropriate.

       2.2  Command Aliases

       Command aliases provide a mechanism of associating a command
       name  and  options with a shorter name.	Aliases are defined
       with the alias built-in.   The  form  of  an  alias  command
       definition is:
			     alias name=value
       As with other shell assignments, no space is allowed  before
       or  after  the =.  The characters of an alias name cannot be
       characters that are special to the  shell.  The	replacement
       string, value, can contain any valid shell script, including
       meta-characters such as	pipe  symbols  and  i/o-redirection
       provided  that  they are quoted.  Unlike csh, aliases in ksh
       cannot take  arguments.	 The  equivalent  functionality  of
       aliases	with  arguments  can  only  be	achieved with shell
       fucntions described later.

       As a command is being read,  the  command  name	is  checked
       against	a list of alias names.	If it is found, the name is
       replaced by the alias value associated with  the  alias	and
       then  rescanned.   When	rescanning  the value for an alias,
       alias substitutions are performed except for an	alias  that
       is  currently being processed.  This prevents infinite loops
       in alias  substitutions.   For  example	with  the  aliases,
       alias l=ls 'ls=ls -C',  the command name l becomes ls, which
       becomes ls -C.  Ordinarily, only the command  name  word  is
       processed  for alias substitution.  However, if the value of
       an alias ends in a space, then the word following the  alias
       is  also  checked  for  alias  substitution.   This makes it
       possible to define an alias whose first argument is the name
       of  a  command and have alias substitution performed on this
       argument, for example nohup='nohup '.

       Aliases can be used to redefine built-in  commands  so  that
       the alias,
			    alias test=./test

       can be used  to	look  for  test  in  your  current  working
       directory  rather  than	using  the  built-in  test command.
       Reserved words such as for and while cannot  be	changed  by
       aliasing.  The command alias, without arguments, generates a
       list of aliases and corresponding alias values.	The unalias
       command removes the name and text of an alias.

       Aliases are used to save typing and to  improve	readability
       of  scripts.   Several  aliases	are predefined by ksh.	For
       example, the predefined alias
			alias integer='typeset -i'
       allows the integer variables i and  j  to  be  declared	and
       initialized with the command
			     integer i=0 j=1

       While  aliases  can  be	defined  in  scripts,  it  is	not
       recommended.   The  location  of  an  alias  command  can be
       important since aliases are only processed when a command is
       read.   A  .   procedure (the shell equivalent to an include
       file) is read all at once (unlike start up files  which	are
       read  a command at a time) so that any aliases defined there
       will not effect any commands within this script.  Predefined
       aliases do not have this problem.

       2.3  Command Re-entry

       When run interactively, ksh saves the commands you type at a
       terminal  in a file.  If the variable HISTFILE is set to the
       name of a file to which the user has write access, then	the
       commands  are  stored  in  this history file.  Otherwise the
       file $HOME/.sh_history is checked for write  access  and  if
       this  fails  an	unnamed  file  is  used to hold the history
       lines.	Commands  are  always  appended   to   this   file.
       Instances  of  ksh  that  run  concurrently and use the same
       history file name, share access to the history file so  that
       a command entered in one shell will be available for editing
       in another shell.   The	file  may  be  truncated  when	ksh
       determines  that  no  other shell is using the history file.
       The number of commands accessible to the user is  determined
       by  the value of the HISTSIZE variable at the time the shell
       is invoked.  The default value is  128.	 Each  command	may
       consist	of  one  or  more lines since a compound command is
       considered one command.	 If  the  character  !	 is  placed
       within  the  primary prompt string, PS1, then it is replaced
       by the command number each time the prompt is given.

       A built-in command named hist is used to  list  and/or  edit
       any  of	these  saved  commands.   The  option -l is used to
       specify listing	of  previous  commands.   The  command	can
       always  be  specified  with a range of one or more commands.
       The range can be specified by  giving  the  command  number,
       relative  or  absolute,	or by giving the first character or
       characters of the command.  When  given	without  specifying
       the range, the last 16 commands are listed, each preceded by
       the command number.

       If the listing option is not selected,  then  the  range  of
       commands  specified,  or  the  last  command  if no range is
       given, is passed to  an	editor	program  before  being	re-
       executed  by  ksh.   The  editor to be used may be specified
       with the option -e and following it with  the  editor  name.
       If  this  option  is  not  specified, the value of the shell
       variable HISTEDIT  is  used  as	the  name  of  the  editor,
       providing  that	this  variable has non-null value.  If this
       variable is not set, or is null, and the -e option  has	not
       been  selected, then /bin/ed is used.  When editing has been
       complete, the edited text automatically	becomes  the  input
       for ksh.  As this text is read by ksh, it is echoed onto the
       terminal.

       The -s option causes the editing to  be	bypassed  and  just
       re-executes the command.  In this case only a single command
       can be specified as the range and an  optional  argument  of
       the form old=new may be added which requests a simple string
       substitution prior to evaluation.  A convenient alias,
			    alias r='hist -s'
       has been pre-defined so that the single key-stroke r can  be
       used  to  re-execute the previous command and the key-stroke
       sequence, r abc=def c can be used  to  re-execute  the  last
       command	that  starts  with  the  letter  c  with  the first
       occurrence of the string abc replaced with the  string  def.
       Typing	r c > file  re-executes  the  most  recent  command
       starting with the letter c, with standard output  redirected
       to file.

       2.4  In-line editing

       Lines typed from a terminal  frequently	need  changes  made
       before entering them.  With the Bourne shell the only method
       to fix up commands is by backspacing or	killing  the  whole
       line.   ksh offers options that allow the user to edit parts
       of the current command line before submitting  the  command.

       The in-line edit options make the command line into a single
       line screen edit window.  When the command  is  longer  than
       the  width of the terminal, only a portion of the command is
       visible.  Moving within the line  automatically	makes  that
       portion	visible.   Editing  can be performed on this window
       until the return key is pressed.   The  editing	modes  have
       editing	directives  that  access  the history file in which
       previous commands are saved.  A user can  copy  any  of	the
       most  recent HISTSIZE commands from this file into the input
       edit window.  You can locate commands  by  searching  or  by
       position.

       The in-line editing  options  do  not  use  the	termcap  or
       terminfo  databases.   They work on most standard terminals.
       They only require that the  backspace  character  moves	the
       cursor  left  and the space character overwrites the current
       character on the screen and moves the cursor to	the  right.
       Very  few  terminals  or terminal emulators do not have this
       behavior.

       There is a choice of editor options.  The emacs,  gmacs,  or
       vi option is selected by turning on the corresponding option
       of the set command.  If the value of the  EDITOR  or  VISUAL
       variables  ends with any of these suffixes the corresponding
       option is turned on.   A  large	subset	of  each  of  these
       editors'   features   are   available   within	the  shell.
       Additional functions, such as  file  name  completion,  have
       also been added.

       In the emacs or gmacs mode the user positions the cursor  to
       the  point  needing  correction	and  inserts,  deletes,  or
       replaces characters as needed.  The only difference  between
       these two modes is the meaning of the directive ^T.  Control
       keys and escape sequences are used  for	cursor	positioning
       and  control functions.	The available editing functions are
       listed in the manual page.

       The vi editing mode starts in insert mode and enters control
       mode when the user types ESC ( 033 ).  The return key, which
       submits the current command for processing, can	be  entered
       from  either  mode.  The cursor can be anywhere on the line.
       A  subset  of  commonly	used  vi  editing  directives	are
       available.  The k and j directives that normally move up and
       down by one line, move  up  and	down  one  command  in	the
       history	file,  copying	the  command  into  the  input edit
       window.	For reasons of efficiency, the terminal is kept  in

				  - 8 -



       canonical  mode	until  an ESC is typed.  On some terminals,
       and on earlier versions of the UNIX operating  system,  this
       doesn't work correctly.	The viraw option, which always uses
       raw or cbreak mode, must be used in this case.

       Most of the code for the editing options does  not  rely  on
       the ksh code and can be used in a stand-alone mode with most
       any command to add in-line edit	capability.   However,	all
       versions  of the in-line editors have some features that use
       some shell specific code.  For example, with all edit modes,
       the ESC-= directive applied to command words (the first word
       on the line, or the first word after a ;, |, (, or &)  lists
       all  aliases,  functions, or commands that match the portion
       of the given current word.  When  applied  to  other  words,
       this  directive	prints	the  names  of files that match the
       current word.  The ESC-* directive adds the expanded list of
       matching  files	to the command line.  A trailing * is added
       to the word if it doesn't contain any file pattern  matching
       characters  before  the expansion.  In emacs and gmacs mode,
       ESC-ESC indicates command completion when applied to command
       names,  otherwise  it  indicates  pathname completion.  With
       command or pathname completion, the list  generated  by	the
       ESC-=  directive  is  examined  to  find  the longest common
       prefix.	With command completion, only the last component of
       the  pathname is used to compute the longest command prefix.
       If the longest common prefix is a complete match, then  word
       is replaced by the pathname, and a / is appended if pathname
       is a directory, otherwise a space is added.  In vi  mode,  \
       from control mode gives the same behavior.

       2.5  Key Binding

       It is possible to intercept keys as  they  are  entered	and
       apply  new  meanings  or  bindings.   A	trap named KEYBD is
       evaluated each time the user enters a key from the keyboard,
       except  while  entering a search string or an argument to an
       edit directive such as r in vi-mode.  The action  associated
       with  this  trap  can change the value of the entered key to
       cause the key to perform a different operation.

       When the KEYBD trap  is	entered,  the  .sh.edtext  variable
       contains  the  contents	of  the  current input line and the
       .sh.edcol variable gives the current cursor position  within
       this   line.   The  .sh.edmode  variable  contains  the	ESC
       character when the trap is entered from insert  mode  of  vi
       mode.   Otherwise,  this  value	is  null.   The  .sh.edchar

       variable contains the  character  or  escape  sequence  that
       caused  the trap.  The value of .sh.edchar at the end of the
       trap will be used as the input sequence.

       Using the associative array facility of ksh described later,
       and  the  function  facility  of  ksh, it is easy to write a
       single trap so that keys  can  be  bound  dynamically.	For
       example,

	    typeset -A Keybind
	    trap 'eval "${Keybind[${.sh.edchar}]}"' KEYBD
	    function keybind # key seq
	    {
		   Keybind[$1]=".sh.edchar=${.sh.edmode}$2"
	    }


       2.6  Job Control

       The job control mechanism is almost identical to the version
       found  in csh of the Berkeley UNIX operating system, version
       4.1 and later.  The job control feature allows the  user  to
       stop  and restart programs, and to move programs to and from
       the foreground and the background.  It  will  only  work  on
       systems	that  provide support for these features.  However,
       even systems without job control have a monitor option which
       when  enabled,  will  report the progress of background jobs
       and enable the user to kill jobs by job number or job name.

       An interactive shell associates a  job  with  each  pipeline
       typed  in from the terminal and assigns them a small integer
       number  called  the  job  number.   If  the   job   is	run
       asynchronously,	the  job number is printed at the terminal.
       At any given time, only one job	owns  the  terminal,  i.e.,
       keyboard  signals are only sent to the processes in one job.
       When ksh creates a foreground job, it gives it ownership  of
       the  terminal.  If you are running a job and wish to stop it
       you hit the key ^Z (control-Z) which sends a STOP signal  to
       all  processes  in  the	current  job.	The  shell receives
       notification that the processes have stopped and takes  back
       control of the terminal.

       There are commands to continue programs	in  the  foreground
       and  background.   There  are several ways to refer to jobs.
       The character % introduces a job name.	You  can  refer  to
       jobs by name or number as described in the manual page.	The

       built-in command bg allows you to  continue  a  job  in	the
       background,  while  the	built-in  command  fg allows you to
       continue a job in the foreground even though  you  may  have
       started it in the background.

       A job being run in the background will stop if it  tries  to
       read  from  the	terminal.   It	is  also  possible  to stop
       background jobs that try to write on the terminal by setting
       the terminal options appropriately.

       There is a built-in command jobs that lists  the  status  of
       all running and stopped jobs.  In addition, you are informed
       of  the	change	of  state  (running  or  stopped)  of	any
       background  jobs just before each prompt.  If you want to be
       notified about background job completions as  soon  as  they
       occur  without  waiting	for  a	prompt, then use the notify
       option.	When you try to  exit  the  shell  while  jobs	are
       stopped or running, you will receive a message from ksh.  If
       you ignore this message and try to exit again,  all  stopped
       processes  will	be  terminated.   In  addition,  for  login
       shells, the HUP signal will be sent to all  background  jobs
       unless the job has been disowned with the disown command.

       A built-in version of kill makes  it  possible  to  use	job
       numbers	as targets for signals.  Signals can be selected by
       number or name.	The name of the signal is the name found in
       the  include  file /usr/include/sys/signal.h with the prefix
       SIG removed.  The -l option of kill provides a means to	map
       individual  signal  names  to  and  from  signal number.  In
       addition, if no signal name  or	number	is  given,  kill -l
       generates a list of valid signal names.

       2.7  Changing Directories

       By default, ksh maintains a logical view of the file  system
       hierarchy  which  makes	symbolic  links  transparent.	For
       systems that have symbolic links, this means that if /bin is
       a  symbolic  link  to  /usr/bin	and you change directory to
       /bin, pwd will indicate that you are in /bin, not  /usr/bin.
       pwd -P  generates  the  physical  pathname  of  the  present
       working directory by resolving all the symbolic	links.	 By
       default, the cd command will take you where you expect to go
       even if you cross symbolic links.  A subsequent cd .. in the
       example	above  will  place  you in /, not /usr.  On systems
       with  symbolic  links,  cd -P  causes  ..   to  be   treated
       physically.

       ksh remembers your last directory in  the  variable  OLDPWD.
       The  cd	built-in  can be given with argument - to return to
       the previous directory and prints the name of the directory.
       Note  that  cd -  done  twice  returns  you  to the starting
       directory, not the second previous directory.   A  directory
       stack  manager  has  been written as shell functions to push
       and pop directories from the stack.

       2.8  Prompts

       When ksh reads commands from a terminal, it issues a  prompt
       whenever it is ready to accept more input and then waits for
       the user to respond.  The TMOUT variable can be	set  to  be
       the  number  of	seconds  that the shell will wait for input
       before terminating.  A 60 second warning message is  printed
       before terminating.

       The shell uses two prompts.  The primary prompt, defined  by
       the  value  of  the  PS1 variable, is issued at the start of
       each command.  The secondary prompt defined by the value  of
       the  PS2  variable,  is	issued when more input is needed to
       complete a command.

       ksh  allows  that  user	to  specify  a	list  of  files  or
       directories  to	check  before  issuing the PS1 prompt.	The
       variable MAILPATH is a colon ( : ) separated  list  of  file
       names  to  be  checked for changes periodically. The user is
       notified before the next prompt.  Each of the names in  this
       list can be followed by a ?  and a prompt to be given when a
       change has been detected in the file.  The  prompt  will  be
       evaluated  for  parameter  substitution.   The  parameter $_
       within a mail message will evaluate to the name of the  file
       that  has  changed.   The  parameter  MAILCHECK	is  used to
       specify the minimal interval in seconds before new  mail  is
       checked for.

       In addition to replacing each !	 in  the  prompt  with	the
       command	version,  ksh expands the value of the PS1 variable
       for  parameters	expansions,  arithmetic   expansions,	and
       command	substitutions  as  described  below to generate the
       prompt.	The expansion characters that  are  to	be  applied
       when  the  prompt  is  issued  must be quoted to prevent the
       expansions from occurring when assigning the value  to  PS1.
       For example, PS1="$PWD" causes PS1 to be set to the value of
       PWD at the time of the assignment whereas PS1='$PWD'  causes
       PWD to be expanded at the time the prompt is issued.

       Command substitution  may  require  a  separate	process  to
       execute	and  cause  the prompt display to be somewhat slow,
       especially when the return key is pressed several times in a
       row.   Therefore,  its  use within PS1 is discouraged.  Some
       variables are maintained by ksh so that their values can  be
       used  with PS1.	The PWD variable stores the pathname of the
       current working directory.  The value of SECONDS variable is
       the  value  of  the  most recent assignment plus the elapsed
       time.  By default, the time is  measured  in  milli-seconds,
       but  since  SECONDS is a floating point variable, the number
       of places after the decimal point in the expanded value	can
       be specified with typeset -Fplaces SECONDS.  In a roundabout
       way, this variable can be used to generate a time stamp into
       the  PS1  prompt  without creating a process at each prompt.
       The following code explains how you can do this on System V.
       On  BSD,  you need another command to initialize the SECONDS
       variable.


	    # . this script and use $TIME as part of your PS1 string to
	    # get the time of day in your prompt
	    typeset -RZ2  _x1 _x2 _x3
	    (( SECONDS=$(date  '+3600*%H+60*%M+%S') ))
	    _s='_x1=(SECONDS/3600)%24,_x2=(SECONDS/60)%60,_x3=SECONDS%60,0'
	    TIME='"${_d[_s]}$_x1:$_x2:$_x3"'
	    # PS1=${TIME}whatever



       2.9  Tilde substitution

       The character ~ at the  beginning  of  a  word  has  special
       meaning	to  ksh.   If  the characters after the ~ up to a /
       match a user login name in the password database, then the ~
       and  the  name  are replaced by that user's login directory.
       If no match is found, the original word is unchanged.   A  ~
       by  itself,  or in front of a /, is replaced by the value of
       the HOME parameter.  A ~ followed by a + or - is replaced by
       the value of $PWD and $OLDPWD respectively.

       2.10  Output formats

       The output of  built-in	commands  and  traces  have  values
       quoted  so  that  they  can  be re-input to the shell.  This
       makes it easy to use cut and paste shell output	on  systems
       which  use  a pointing device such as a mouse.  In addition,

       output can be saved in a file for reuse.

       2.11  The ENV file

       When an	interactive  ksh  starts,  it  evaluates  the  $ENV
       variable  to  arrive  at  a file name.  If this value is not
       null, ksh attempts to read and process commands in a file by
       this  name.   Earlier  versions of ksh read the ENV file for
       all invocations of the shell  primarily	to  allow  function
       definitions  to be available for all shell invocations.	The
       function search path, FPATH, described later, eliminated the
       primary	need for this capability and it was removed because
       the high performance cost was no longer deemed acceptable.


       3.  PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

       The KornShell vastly extends the set  of  applications  that
       can  be implemented efficiently at the shell level.  It does
       this by providing simple yet powerful mechanisms to  perform
       arithmetic,  pattern  matching,	substring  generation,	and
       arrays.	Users can write applications as separate  functions
       that  can  be  defined  in  the same file or in a library of
       functions stored in a directory and loaded on demand.

       3.1  String Processing

       The shell is primarily a  string  processing  language.	 By
       default,  variables hold variable length strings.  There are
       no limits to the length of strings.  Storage  management  is
       handled	by  the  shell automatically.  Declarations are not
       required.  With most programming languages, string constants
       are  designated	by enclosing characters in single quotes or
       double quotes.  Since most of the words in the language	are
       strings,  the  shell  requires  quotes  only  when  a string
       contains characters that are normally processed specially by
       the  shell, but their literal meaning is intended.  However,
       since the shell is a string processing  language,  and  some
       characters   can   occur   as   literals   and  as  language
       metacharacters,	quoting  is  an  important  part   of	the
       language.

       There are four quoting mechanisms in ksh.  The  simplest  is
       to  enclose  a  sequence of characters inside single quotes.
       All characters between a pair of single	quotes	have  their
       literal meaning; the single quote itself cannot appear.	A $

				  - 14 -



       immediately preceding a single quoted string causes all	the
       characters until the matching single quote to be interpreted
       as  an  ANSI-C  language  string.   Thus,  '\n'	 represents
       characters  \  and n, whereas, $'\n' represents the new-line
       character.  Double quoted strings remove the special meaning
       of  all	characters  except  $,	and  `,  so  that parameter
       expansion  and  command	substitution  (defined	below)	are
       performed.   The  final mechanism for quoting a character is
       by preceding it with the escape character \.  This mechanism
       works outside of quoted strings and for the characters $, `,
       ", and \ in double quoted strings.

       Variables  are  designated  by  one  or	more   strings	 of
       alphanumeric   characters   beginning   with  an  alphabetic
       character separated by a ..  Upper and lowercase  characters
       are  distinct,  so  that  the  variable A and a are names of
       different variables.  There is no limit to the length of the
       name  of  a variable.  You do not have to declare variables.
       You can assign a value to a variable by writing the name  of
       the  variable,  followed  by  an  equal	sign, followed by a
       character string that represents its  value.   To  create  a
       variable  whose	name  contains a ., the variable whose name
       consists of the characters before the last .   must  already
       exist.	You reference a variable by putting the name inside
       curly braces and preceding the braces with  a  dollar  sign.
       The braces may be omitted when the name is alphanumeric.  If
       x and y are two	shell  variables,  then  to  define  a	new
       variable,  z, whose value is the concatenation of the values
       of x and y, you just say z=$x$y.  It is that easy.

       The $ can be thought of as meaning "value of." You can  also
       capture	 the  output  of  any  command	with  the  notation
       $(command).  This is referred to  as  command  substitution.
       For  example,  x=$(date)  assigns  the  output from the date
       command to the variable	x.   Command  substitution  in	the
       Bourne  shell  is  denoted  by enclosing the command between
       backquotes,  (``).   This   notation   suffers	from   some
       complicated  quoting  rules.   Thus, it is hard to write sed
       patterns  which	contains  back	 slashes   within   command
       substitution.   Putting	the  pattern in single quotes is of
       little  help.   ksh  accepts  the   Bourne   shell   command
       substitution   syntax   for   backward  compatibility.	The
       $(command) notation allows the  command	itself	to  contain
       quoted strings even if the substitution occurs within double
       quotes. Nesting is legal.

       The special command substitution of the form $(cat file) can
       be  replaced  by  $(< file), which is faster because the cat
       command doesn't have to run.

       3.2  Shell Parameters and Variables

       There are three types of parameters  used  by  ksh,  special
       parameters,  positional	parameters,  and  named  parameters
       which are called variables.  ksh defines  the  same  special
       characters,  0, *, @, #, ?, $, !, and -, as they are defined
       in the Bourne shell.

       Positional parameters are set when the shell is invoked,  as
       arguments  to  the  set	built-in, and by calls to functions
       (see below) and .  procedures.  They are named by  a  number
       starting at 1.

       The third type of parameter is  a  variable.   As  mentioned
       earlier,  ksh  uses  variables whose names consist of one or
       more alpha-numeric strings separated by a ..   There  is  no
       need to specify the type of a variable in the shell because,
       by default, variables store strings of arbitrary length	and
       values  will automatically be converted to numbers when used
       in an arithmetic context.  However, ksh variables  can  have
       one   or   more	 attributes   that   control  the  internal
       representation of the variable,	the  way  the  variable  is
       printed,  and  its access or scope.  In addition, ksh allows
       variables to represent arrays of values	and  references  to
       other  variables.   The	typeset  built-in  command  of	ksh
       assigns attributes to variables.   Two  of  the	attributes,
       readonly  and  export,  are  available  in the Bourne shell.
       Most of the remaining attributes are  discussed	here.	The
       complete  list  of  attributes  appears	in the manual.	The
       unset built-in of  ksh  removes	values	and  attributes  of
       variables.   When  a  variable  is  exported, certain of its
       attributes are also exported.

       Whenever a value is assigned to a  variable,  the  value  is
       transformed  according  to  the	attributes of the variable.
       Changing the attribute of a variable can change	its  value.
       The  attributes	-L  and  -R  are  for  left and right field
       justification respectively.  They are  useful  for  aligning
       columns	in a report.  For each of these attributes, a width
       can be defined explicitly or else it is	defined  the  first
       time an assignment is made to the variable.  Each assignment
       causes justification of the field, truncating if  necessary.

       Assignment  to  fixed  sized  variables	provides one way to
       generate  a  substring  consisting  of  a  fixed  number  of
       characters  from  the  beginning  or end of a string.  Other
       methods are discussed later.

       The attributes -u and -l, are used for upper case and  lower
       case  formatting  respectively.	 Since it makes no sense to
       have both attributes on simultaneously, turning on either of
       these attributes turns the other off.  The following script,
       using read and print which are described later, provides  an
       example of the use of shell variables with attributes.  This
       script reads a file of lines each consisting of five  fields
       separated  by  :  and prints fields 4 and 2 in upper case in
       columns 1-15,  left  justified,	and  columns  20-25  right-
       justified respectively.

	    typeset -uL15 f4		    # 15 character left justified
	    typeset -uR6 f2		    # 6 character right justified
	    IFS=:			    # set field separator to :
	    while   read -r f1 f2 f3 f4 f5  # read line, split into fields
	    do	    print -r -- "$f4  $f2"  # print fields 4 and 2
	    done


       The -i,	-E,  and  -F,  attributes  are	used  to  represent
       numbers.   Each can be followed by a decimal number.  The -i
       attribute causes the value to be represented as	an  integer
       and  it can be followed by a number representing the numeric
       base when expanding its value.  Whenever a value is assigned
       to  an  integer	variable,  it is evaluated as an arithmetic
       expression and then truncated to an integer.

       The -E attribute causes	the  value  to	be  represented  in
       scientific  notation  whenever  its  value is expanded.	The
       number following the -E determines the number of significant
       figures,  and  defaults	to  6.	The -F attribute causes the
       value to be represented with a fixed number of places  after
       the  decimal point. Assignments to variables of the -E or -F
       cause  the  evaluation  of  the	right  hand  side  of	the
       assignment.

       ksh allows one-dimensional  arrays  in  addition  to  simple
       variables.   There  are	two  types  of	arrays; associative
       arrays and indexed arrays.  The subscript for an associative
       array  is  an arbitrary string, whereas the subscript for an
       indexed array is an arithmetic expression that is  evaluated

       to  yield  an  integer  index.	Any  variable can become an
       indexed array by referring to  it  with	a  subscript.	All
       elements  of an array need not exist.  Subscripts for arrays
       must evaluate to an  integer  between  0  and  some  maximum
       value,  otherwise  an  error results.  The maximum value may
       vary from one machine to  another  but  is  at  least  4095.
       Evaluation  of  subscripts is described in the next section.
       Attributes apply to the whole array.

       Assignments to array variables can  be  made  to  individual
       elements  via  parameter  assignment commands or the typeset
       built-in.  Additionally, values can be assigned sequentially
       using the -A name option of the set command.  Referencing of
       subscripted variables requires the  character  $,  but  also
       requires  braces  around the array element name.  The braces
       are needed to avoid conflicts with the file name  generation
       mechanism.  The form of any array element reference is:
			   ${name[subscript]}.
       A subscript value of * or @ can	be  used  to  generate	all
       elements  of  an  array,  as  they are used for expansion of
       positional  parameters.	 The  list  of	currently   defined
       subscripts  for	a  given  variable  can  be  generated with
       ${!name[@]}, or ${!name[*]}.

       The nameref attribute causes the variable to be treated as a
       reference  to  the variable defined by its value.  Once this
       attribute is set, all references  to  this  variable  become
       references  to  the  variable  named  by  the  value of this
       variable.   For	example,  if  foo=bar,	then  setting	the
       reference   attribute   on  foo	will  call  all  subsequent
       references to foo to behave as references to bar.  Unsetting
       this  attribute breaks the association.	Reference variables
       are usually used inside functions whose	arguments  are	the
       name  of a shell variable. The names for reference variables
       cannot  contain	a  ..	Whenever  a   shell   variable	 is
       referenced,  the  portion  of the variable up to the first .
       is checked to see whether it matches the name of a reference
       variable.   If  it  does,  then	the  name  of  the variable
       actually used consists of the concatenation of the  name  of
       the  variable  defined  by  the reference plus the remaining
       portion of the original variable name.  For  example,  using
       the predefined alias, alias nameref='typeset -n',

	    .bar.home.bam="hello world"
	    nameref foo=.bar.home
	    print ${foo.bam}

       3.3  Substring Generation

       The expansion of a variable or parameter can be modified  so
       that  only  a  portion  of  the	value  results. It is often
       necessary to extract a portion of  a  shell  variable  or  a
       portion	of an array.  There are several parameter expansion
       operators that can  do  this.   One  method  to	generate  a
       substring    is	  with	  an	expansion   of	 the   form
       ${name:offset:length}  where   offset   is   an	 arithmetic
       expression  that  defines  the offset of the first character
       starting from 0, and length is an arithmetic expression that
       defines the length of the substring.  If :length is omitted,
       the length of the value of name starting at offset is  used.
       The  :offset:length  operators  can also be applied to array
       expansions and to parameters * and @ to generate portions of
       an      array.	    For     example,	 the	 expansion,
       ${name[@]:offset:length}, yields up to  length  elements  of
       the array name starting at the element offset.

       The other parameter expansion modifiers use  shell  patterns
       to  describe portions of the string to modify and delete.  A
       description of shell  patterns  is  contained  below.   When
       these modifiers are applied to special parameters @ and * or
       to  array  parameters  given  as  name[@]  or  name[*],	the
       operation  is  performed  on  each  element.  There are four
       parameter substitution modifiers that strip off leading	and
       trailing   substrings   during	parameter  substitution  by
       removing  the  characters  matching  a  given  pattern.	 An
       expansion  of  the  form ${name#pattern} causes the smallest
       matching prefix of the value of name  to  be  removed.	The
       largest	prefix	matching  pattern  is  removed	by using ##
       instead	of  #.	 Similarly,  an  expansion  of	 the   form
       ${name%pattern}	causes	the  smallest matching substring at
       the end of name to be removed.  Again, using %%	instead  of
       %,  causes  the	largest  matching  trailing substring to be
       deleted.  For example, if the shell variable file has  value
       foo.c, then the expression ${file%.c}.o has value foo.o.

       The value of an expansion can be  changed  by  specifying  a
       pattern that matches the part that needs to be changed after
       the the parameter expansion modifier /.	An expansion of the
       form  ${name/pattern/string}  replaces  the  first  match of
       pattern with the value of  variable  name  to  string.	The

       second  /  is  not  necessary  when  string  is	null.	The
       expansion ${name//pattern/string} changes all occurrences of
       the  pattern into string.  The parameter expansion modifiers
       /# and /% cause the matching pattern to be anchored  to	the
       beginning and end respectively.

       Finally, there are parameter expansion modifiers that yield,
       the  name of the variable, the string length of the value or
       the number of elements of an  array.   ${!name}	yields	the
       name  of  the variable which will be name itself except when
       name is a reference variable.  In this case  it	will  yield
       the name of the variable it refers to.  ${#name} will be the
       length in bytes of $name.  For an array variable ${#name[*]}
       gives the number of elements in the array.

       3.4  Arithmetic Evaluation

       For  the  most  part,  the  shell  is  a  string  processing
       language.   However,  the  need for arithmetic has long been
       obvious.  Many of the characters that  are  special  to	the
       Bourne  shell,  are needed as arithmetic operators.  To make
       arithmetic easy to use, and to maintain	compatibility  with
       the  Bourne  shell, ksh uses matching (( and )) to delineate
       arithmetic expressions.	While single parentheses might have
       been  more  desirable,  these  already mean subshell so that
       another notation was required.	The  arithmetic  expression
       inside  the  double  parentheses  follows  that same syntax,
       associativity and precedence as the  ANSI-C[15]	programming
       language.    The  characters  between  the  matching  double
       parentheses are processed  with	the  same  rules  used	for
       double  quotes so that spaces can be used to aid readability
       without additional quoting.

       All  arithmetic	evaluations  are  performed  using   double
       precision   floating   point   arithmetic.   Floating  point
       constants follow the same rules as  the	ANSI-C	programming
       language.  Integer arithmetic constants are written as
			       base#number,
       where base is a decimal integer between two  and  sixty-four
       and  number  is	any  non-negative number.  Base ten is used
       when no base is specified.  The digits  are  represented  by
       the characters 0-9a-zA-Z_@.  For bases less than or equal to
       36,  upper  and	lower	case   characters   can   be   used
       interchangibly to represent the digits from 10 thru 35.

       Arithmetic expressions are made from  constants,  variables,
       operators.   Parentheses  may  be  used	for  grouping.	The
       contents inside the double parentheses  are  processed  with
       the  same expansions as occurs in a double quoted string, so
       that all $ expansions are performed  before  the  expression
       are  performed.	 However,  there is no need to use the $ to
       get the value of a variable because the arithmetic evaluator
       replaces  the  name  of	the variable by its value within an
       arithmetic expression.	The  $	cannot	be  used  when	the
       variable  is  the  subject  of  assignment  or  an increment
       operation.  As a rule it is better not to use $ in front  of
       variables in an arithmetic expression.

       An arithmetic command of the form (( ...  ))  is  a  command
       that  evaluates	the  enclosed  arithmetic  expression.	For
       example, the command
				(( x++ ))
       can be used to increment the variable  x,  assuming  that  x
       contains  some  numerical  value.  The arithmetic command is
       true (return value 0),  when  the  resulting  expression  is
       non-zero,  and  false  (return  value 1) when the expression
       evaluates to zero.  This makes the command easy to use  with
       the if and while compound command.

       The for compound  command  has  been  extended  for  use  in
       arithmetic contexts. The syntax,
		      for (( expr1; expr2 ; expr3 ))
       can be used as the first line of a for loop  with  the  same
       semantics  as  the  for	statement in the ANSI-C programming
       language.

       Arithmetic evaluations can also be performed as part of	the
       evaluation of a command line.  The syntax $(( ... )) expands
       to the value of the enclosed  arithmetic  expression.   This
       expansion   can	 occur	 wherever  parameter  expansion  is
       performed.   For  example  using  the  ksh   command   print
       (described later)
			      print $((2+2))
       prints the number 4.

       The following  script  prints  the  first  n  lines  of	its
       standard  input	onto  its  standard  output, where n can be
       supplied as an optional argument whose default value is 20.

	    integer n=${1-20}			    # set n
	    while   (( n-- >=0 )) && read -r line   # at most n lines

       3.5  Shell Expansions

       The commands you enter from the terminal or  from  a  script
       are  divided  into  words  and  each  word undergoes several
       expansions to generate the command name and  its  arguments.
       This  is  done  in  two	phases.  The first phase recognizes
       reserved words, spaces and operators to decide where command
       boundaries  lie.  Alias substitutions take place during this
       phase.	The  second  phase  performs  expansions   in	the
       following order:

	  + Tilde  substitution,  parameter  expansion,  arithmetic
	    expansion,	and command substitution are performed from
	    left to right.

	  + The characters that result from parameter expansion and
	    command   substitution   above  are  checked  with	the
	    characters in  the	IFS  variable  for  possible  field
	    splitting.	(See a description of read below to see how
	    IFS is used.) Setting IFS to a null value causes  field
	    splitting to be skipped.

	  + Pathname generation (as described below)  is  performed
	    on	each of the fields.  Any field that doesn't match a
	    pathname is left alone.  The option, -f or	noglob,  is
	    used to disable pathname generation.

       3.6  Pattern Matching

       The shell is primarily a string processing language and uses
       patterns  for  matching	file  names as well as for matching
       strings.  The characters ?, *, and [ are processed specially
       by  the shell when not quoted.  These characters are used to
       form patterns that match strings.  Patterns are used by	the
       shell  to  match  pathnames,  to specify substrings, and for
       case commands.  The character ?	matches any one  character.
       The  character  *  matches  zero  or  more  characters.	The
       character sequence [...]  defines  a  character	class  that
       matches	any  character	contained  within  [].	 A range of
       characters can be specified by putting a - between the first
       and  last  character  of the range.  An exclamation mark, !,
       immediately after the [, means match all  characters  except


		      BELL LABORATORIES PROPRIETARY
       Not for use or disclosure outside Bell Laboratories except by
    written approval of the director of the distributing organization.











				  - 22 -



       the   characters   specified.	For  example,  the  pattern
       a?c*.[!a-z] matches any string beginning with  an  a,  whose
       third  character  is a c, and that ends in .  (dot) followed
       by any character except the  lowercase  letters,  a-z.	The
       sequence [:alpha:] inside a character class, matches any set
       of  characters  in  the	ANSI-C	alpha  class.	 Similarly,
       [:class:]  matches each of the characters in the given class
       for all the ANSI-C character classes.

       ksh treats  strings  of	the  form  (pattern-list)  ,  where
       pattern-list  is a list of one or more patterns separated by
       a |, specially when preceded by *, ?,  +,  @,  or  !.   A  ?
       preceding   (pattern-list)   means  that  the  pattern  list
       enclosed in () is optional.  An @(pattern-list) matches	any
       pattern	 in  the  list	of  patterns  enclosed	in  ().   A
       *(pattern-list) matches any string  that  contains  zero  or
       more  of  each  of the enclosed patterns, whereas +(pattern-
       list) requires a match of one or more of any  of  the  given
       patterns.   For	instance,  the pattern +([0-9])?(.) matches
       one or more digits  optionally  followed  by  a	.(dot).   A
       !(pattern-list)	matches  anything  except  any of the given
       patterns.  For example, print !(*.o) will display  any  file
       name that does not end in .o.

       When patterns are used to generate pathnames when  expanding
       commands  several  other  rules	apply.	A separate match is
       made for each matching on each file name  component  of	the
       pathname. Read permission is required for any portion of the
       pathname that contains any special pattern character. Search
       permission  is  required for every component except possibly
       the last.

       By default, file names in each directory that begin  with  .
       are  skipped  when performing a match.  If the pattern to be
       matched starts with a leading ., then only  files  beginning
       with  a	.,  are considered when finding matching files.  If
       the FIGNORE variable is set, then only  files  that  do	not
       match  this  pattern  are  considered.	This  overrides the
       special meaning of .  in a pattern and in a file name.

       If the markdirs option is set, each matching  pathname  that
       is  the name of a directory has a trailing / appended to the
       name.

       3.7  Conditional Expressions

       The Bourne shell uses the test command, or the equivalent  [
       command,  to  test  the	attributes for files and to compare
       strings or numbers.  The problem with test is that the shell
       has  expanded  the  words of the test command and split them
       into arguments before test begins  execution.   test  cannot
       distinguish  between  operators and operands.  In most cases
       test "$1"  will	test  whether  argument  1   is   non-null.
       However,  if argument 1 is -f, then test will treat -f as an
       operator and yield a syntax error.  One of the most frequent
       errors  with  test  occurs  when its operands are not within
       double quotes.  In this case, the  argument  may  expand  to
       more  than  a  single argument or to no argument at all.  In
       either case this will likely cause  a  syntax  error.   What
       makes   this   most  insidious  is  that  these	errors	are
       frequently data dependent.  A script  that  appears  to	run
       correctly may abort if given unexpected data.

       To get around these problems, ksh has a compound command for
       condition  expression  testing as part of the language.	The
       reserved words [[ and ]] delimit the range of  the  command.
       Because	they  are  reserved words, not operator characters,
       they require spaces to separate them  from  arguments.	The
       words  between  [[  and	]]  are  not  processed  for  field
       splitting or for pathname generation.   In  addition,  since
       ksh  determines	the  operators	before parameter expansion,
       expansions that yield no argument  cause  no  problem.	The
       operators  within  [[...]]  are almost the same as those for
       the test command.  All  unary  operators  are  of  the  form
       -letter and are followed by a single operand.  Instead of -a
       and -o, [[...]] uses && and || to indicate "and"  and  "or".
       Parentheses are used without quoting for grouping.

       The right hand side of the string  comparison  operators  ==
       and  !=	take  a  pattern  and  tests  whether the left hand
       operand matches this pattern.  Quoting the  pattern  results
       is  a  string  comparison rather than the pattern match. The
       operators < and > within [[...]]  designate  lexicographical
       comparison.

       In  addition  there  are  several   other   new	 comparison
       primitives.   The  binary  operators -ot and -nt compare the
       modification times of two files to see which file  is  older
       than or newer than the other.  The binary operator -ef tests
       whether two files have the same device  and  i-node  number,

				  - 24 -



       i. e., a link to the same file.

       The unary operator -L returns  true  if	its  operand  is  a
       symbolic link.  The unary operator -O ( -G ) returns true if
       the owner (or group) of the file operand matches that of the
       caller.	The unary operator -o returns true when its operand
       is the name of an option that is currently on.

       The  following  script  illustrates  some  of  the  uses  of
       [[...]].  The reference manual contains the complete list of
       operators.

	    for i in "${@}"
	    do	    # execute foo for numeric directory
		    if	    [[ -d $i && $i == +([0-9]) ]]
		    then    foo
		    # otherwise if writable or executable file and not mine
		    elif    [[ (-w $i||-x $i) && ! -O $i ]]
		    then    bar
		    fi
	    done


       3.8  Input and Output

       ksh has extended I/O capabilities to enhance the use of	the
       shell  as a programming language.  As with the Bourne shell,
       you use the I/O redirection operator, <,  to  control  where
       input  comes  from,  and the I/O redirection operator, >, to
       control where output goes to. Each of these operators can be
       preceded  with  a  single  digit  that specifies a file unit
       number to associate with the file  stream.   Ordinarily	you
       specify	these  I/O  redirection  operators  with a specific
       command to which it applies.  However, if  you  specify	I/O
       redirections  with  the	exec  command,	and  don't  specify
       arguments to exec, then the I/O redirection applies  to	the
       current	program.   For	example,  the command exec < foobar
       opens file foobar for reading.  The  exec  command  is  also
       used  to  close files.  A file descriptor unit can be opened
       as a copy of an	existing  file	descriptor  unit  by  using
       either  of  the	<&  or	>&  operators  and putting the file
       descriptor unit of the original file  after  the  &.   Thus,
       2>&1 means open standard error (file descriptor 2) as a copy
       of standard output (file descriptor 1).	A  file  descriptor
       value  of  -  after  the & indicates that the file should be
       closed.	To close file unit 5, specify exec 5<&-.  There are

       two  additional redirection operators with ksh and the POSIX
       shell that are  not  part  of  the  Bourne  shell.   The  >|
       operator  overrides  the  effect  of  the  noclobber  option
       described earlier.  The <> operator  causes  a  file  to  be
       opened for both reading and writing.

       ksh recognizes certain pathnames and treats them  specially.
       Pathnames of the form /dev/fd/n are treated as equivalent to
       the file defined by file descriptor n.  These  name  can  be
       used  as  the  script  argument	to  ksh  and in conditional
       testing as described  above.   On  underlying  systems  that
       support	/dev/fd  in  the  file	system,  these names can be
       passed  to  other   commands.	Pathnames   of	 the   form
       /dev/tcp/hostid/port and /dev/udp/hostid/port can be used to
       create tcp and udp connections  to  services  given  by	the
       hostid  number  and  port  number.   The  hostid  cannot use
       symbolic values. In practice these are  typically  generated
       by	command       substitution.	  For	   example,
       exec 5> /dev/tcp/$(service name) would open file  descriptor
       5  for sending messages to hostid and port number defined by
       the output of service name.

       The Bourne shell has a built-in	command  read  for  reading
       lines  from standard input (file descriptor 0) and splitting
       it into fields based on the value of the IFS variable, and a
       command echo to write strings to standard output.  ( On some
       systems,  echo  is  not	a  built-in  command   and   incurs
       considerable  overhead  to  use.)  Unfortunately, neither of
       these commands is able to perform  some	very  basic  tasks.
       For  example.   with  the  Bourne  shell,  the read built-in
       cannot read a single line that end in \.  With ksh the  read
       built-in has a -r option to remove the special meaning for \
       which allows it to be treated as a regular character  rather
       than  the  line	continuation  character.   With  the Bourne
       shell, there is no simple way to have  more  than  one  file
       open  at  any time for reading.	ksh has options on the read
       command to specify the file descriptor for the  input.	The
       fields  that  are  read	from  a  line can be stored into an
       indexed array with the -A option to  read.   This  allows  a
       line to be split into an arbitrary number of fields.

       The way the Bourne shell uses  the  IFS	variable  to  split
       lines  into  fields  greatly limits its utility.  Often data
       files consist of lines that use a character  such  as  :  to
       delimit	fields	with  two adjacent delimiters that denote a
       null field.  The Bourne shell treats adjacent delimiters  as


		      BELL LABORATORIES PROPRIETARY
       Not for use or disclosure outside Bell Laboratories except by
    written approval of the director of the distributing organization.











				  - 26 -



       a  single  field  delimiter.   With ksh, delimiters that are
       considered white space characters have the behavior  of	the
       Bourne  shell,  but  other adjacent delimiters separate null
       fields.

       The read command is often used in scripts that interact with
       the  user  by  prompting  the  user and then requesting some
       input.  With the Bourne shell two commands are  needed;	one
       to prompt the user, the other to read the reply.  ksh allows
       these two commands to be combined.  The	first  argument  of
       the read command can be followed by a ?	and a prompt string
       which is used whenever  the  input  device  is  a  terminal.
       Because the prompt is associated with the read built-in, the
       built-in command line editors will be able to re-output	the
       prompt  whenever the line needs to be refreshed when reading
       from a terminal device.

       With the Bourne shell, there is no way to set a	time  limit
       for waiting for the user response to read.  The -t option to
       read takes a floating point argument that gives the time  in
       seconds,  or fractions of seconds that the shell should wait
       for a reply.

       The version of the echo command in System V  treats  certain
       sequences beginning with \ as control sequences.  This makes
       it hard to output strings without interpretation.  Most	BSD
       derived	systems  do  not  interpret  \	control  sequences.
       Unfortunately, the BSD versions of echo accepts a -n  option
       to  prevent a trailing new-line, but has no way to cause the
       string -n to be	printed.   Neither  of	these  versions  is
       adequate.  Also,  because  they are incompatible, it is very
       hard to write portable shell scripts using  echo.   The	ksh
       built-in,  print, outputs characters to the terminal or to a
       file and subsumes the functions of  all	versions  of  echo.
       Ordinarily,  escape  sequences in arguments beginning with \
       are processed the same as for the  System  V  echo  command.
       However	print  follows the standard conventions for options
       and has options that make  print  very  versatile.   The  -r
       option  can  be	used  to  output  the arguments without any
       special meaning.  The -n option can be used here to suppress
       the  trailing new-line that is ordinarily appended.  As with
       read, it is possible to specify the file  descriptor  number
       as  an  option  to  the	command  to  avoid  having  to	use
       redirection operators with each occurrence of the command.

       The IEEE POSIX shell and utilities  standard  committee	was
       unable to reconcile the differences between the System V and
       BSD versions of echo.  They introduced a new  command  named
       printf  which  takes  an  ANSI-C format string and a list of
       options and outputs the strings using the ANSI-C  formatting
       rules.	Since  ksh  is POSIX conforming, it accepts printf.
       However, there is a -f options to print that can be used  to
       specify	a  format  string which processes the arguments the
       same way that printf does.

       The format processing for print and printf has been extended
       slightly.  There are three additional formatting directives.
       The %b format causes the \ escape sequences to  be  expanded
       as  they  are with the System V echo command.  The %q format
       causes quotes to be placed on the output as required so that
       it  can	be  used as shell input.  Special characters in the
       output of most ksh built-in commands and in the output  from
       an  execution trace are quoted in an equivalent fashion. The
       %P format causes an extended regular expression string to be
       converted  into a shell pattern.  This is useful for writing
       shell applications that have to accept regular expression as
       input.  Finally, the escape sequence \E which expands to the
       terminal escape character (octal 033) has been added.

       The shell is frequently used as a programming  language	for
       interactive  dialogues.	The select statement has been added
       to the language to make it easier to present menu  selection
       alternatives  to  the user and evaluate the reply.  The list
       of alternatives is numbered and	put  in  columns.   A  user
       settable  prompt,  PS3,	is  issued  and  if the answer is a
       number corresponding to one of the alternatives, the  select
       loop  variable is set to this value.  In any case, the REPLY
       variable is used to store the user entered reply.  The shell
       variables  LINES  and COLUMNS are used to control the layout
       of select lists.

       3.9  Co-process

       ksh can spawn a co-process by adding a |& after	a  command.
       This  process  will  be	run with its standard input and its
       standard  output  connected  to	the  shell.   The  built-in
       command	print  with  the  -p  option  will  write  into the
       standard input of this process and the built-in command read
       with  the  -p  option  will  read  from	the  output of this
       process.

       In addition, the I/O redirection operators <& and >& can  be
       used to move the input or output pipe of the co-process to a
       numbered file descriptor.  Use exec 3>& p to move the  input
       of  the	co-process  to	file  descriptor 3.  After you have
       connected to file descriptor 3, you can direct the output of
       any command to the co-process by running command >&3.  Also,
       by  moving  the	input  of  the	co-process  to	a  numbered
       descriptor,  it is possible to run a second co-process.	The
       output of both co-processes  will  be  the  file  descriptor
       associated with read -p.  You can use exec 4< p to cause the
       output of these co-processes to go to file descriptor  4  of
       the shell.  Once you have moved the pipe to descriptor 4, it
       is possible to connect a server to the co-process by running
       command 4<& p   or   to	 close	the  co-process  pipe  with
       exec 4<& -.

       3.10  Functions

       Function definitions are of the form

	    function name
	    {
	    any shell script
	    }

       A function whose name contains a .  is called  a  discipline
       function.   The	portion of the name before the last .  must
       refer to the name of an existing variable.  Thus, if p is  a
       reference to PATH, then the function name p.get and PATH.get
       refer to the same function.

       The function is invoked either by  specifying  name  as	the
       command	name  and optionally following it with arguments or
       by using it  as	an  option  to	the  .	 built-in  command.
       Positional  parameters  are  saved before each function call
       and restored when completed.  The arguments that follow	the
       function   name	 on  the  calling  line  become  positional
       parameters inside the function.	The return built-in can  be
       used  to  cause	the  function  to  return  to the statement
       following the point of invocation.

       Functions can also be defined with the System V notation,

	    name ()
	    {
	    any shell script

				  - 29 -



	    }

       Functions defined with this syntax cannot  be  used  as	the
       first  argument to a . procedure.  ksh accepts this notation
       for compatibility only.	 There	is  no	need  to  use  this
       notation when writing ksh scripts.

       Functions defined with the function name syntax and  invoked
       by  name  are  executed in the current shell environment and
       can  share  named  variables  with  the	 calling   program.
       Options,  other	than execution trace -x, set by the calling
       program are passed down to a function.  The options are	not
       shared  with  the  function so that any options set within a
       function  are  restored	when  the  function  exits.   Traps
       ignored	by  the  caller are ignored within the function and
       cannot be enabled.  Traps caught by the calling program	are
       reset  to  their  default action with the function.  In most
       instances, the default action is to cause  the  function  to
       terminate.   A  trap  on  EXIT,	defined  within  a function
       executes after the function completes but before the  caller
       resumes.    Therefore,  any  variable  assignments  and	any
       options set as part of a trap action will be effective after
       the caller resumes.

       By default, variables are  inherited  by  the  function	and
       shared  by  the	calling  program.   However,  for functions
       defined with the function name syntax that  are	invoked  by
       name,  environment substitutions preceding the function call
       apply only  to  the  scope  of  the  function  call.   Also,
       variables  whose  names do not contain a .  that are defined
       with the typeset built-in command are local to the  function
       that they are declared in.  Thus, for the function defined

	    function  name
	    {
		 typeset -i x=10
		 let z=x+y
		 print $z
	    }

       invoked as y=13 name, x	and  y	are  local  variables  with
       respect to the function name while z is global.

       Functions defined with  the  name()  syntax,  and  functions
       invoked	as  an argument to the .  command, share everything
       other  than   positional   parameters   with   the   caller.

       Assignments that precede the call remain in effect after the
       function completes.

       Alias and function  names  are  not  passed  down  to  shell
       scripts	or carried across separate invocations of ksh.	The
       $FPATH variable gives a colon separated list of	directories
       that  is  searched  for	function definitions when trying to
       resolve the command name.  Whenever a file name contained in
       $FPATH is found, the complete file is read and all functions
       contained within become defined.

       Calls that reference functions can be recursive.  Except for
       special	built-ins,  function  names  take  precedence  over
       built-in names and names of programs when  used	as  command
       names.  To write a function to replace a built-in command or
       to replace a program, you  must	use  the  command  built-in
       command.    The	arguments  to  command	are  the  name	and
       arguments of the program you want to execute.   For  example
       to  write  a  cd  function  which  changes the directory and
       prints out the directory name, you can write,

	    function  cd
	    {
		 if	 command cd  "$@"
		 then	 print	-r -- $PWD
		 fi
	    }


       The FPATH variable is a colon separated list that  ksh  uses
       to  search for function definitions.  When ksh encounters an
       autoload function, it runs the  .   command  on	the  script
       containing the function, and then executes the function.

       Function definitions may also be placed	in  the  ENV  file.
       However,  this  causes  the  shell  to  take longer to begin
       executing.

       3.11  Process Substitution

       This feature is only  available	on  versions  of  the  UNIX
       operating  system  which  support  the /dev/fd directory for
       naming open  files.   Each  command  argument  of  the  form
       <(list)	or  >(list)  will  run	process list asynchronously
       connected to some file in the /dev/fd directory.   The  name
       of  this  file  will become the argument to the command.  If

       the form with > is selected then writing on this  file  will
       provide	input for list.  If < is used, then the file passed
       as an argument will contain the output of the list  process.
       For example,

	    paste  <(cut -f1 file1)  <(cut -fB file2) | tee >(process1)  >(process2)

       extracts fields 1 and 3	from  the  files  file1  and  file2
       respectively,  places the results side by side, and sends it
       to the processes process1 and process2, as well	as  putting
       it  onto  the  standard output.	Note that the file which is
       passed as an argument  to  the  command	is  a  UNIX  system
       pipe(2)	so that the programs that expect to lseek(2) on the
       file will not work.

       3.12  Finding Commands

       The addition of aliases, functions, and more  built-ins	has
       made  it  substantially	more difficult to know what a given
       command word really means.

       There are several reasons that commands are built  into	the
       shell  rather  than  being separate programs.  Commands that
       begin with reserved words are an integral part of the  shell
       language itself and typically define the control flow of the
       language.  Some control flow commands are not reserved words
       in  the	language but are special built-ins.  Special built-
       ins are built-ins that are considered a part of the language
       rather  than  user definable commands.  The best examples of
       commands that fit this description are break  and  continue.
       Because	they are not reserved words, they can be the result
       of shell expansions and are not effected by  quoting.  These
       commands have the following special properties:

	  + Assignments that precede  them  apply  to  the  current
	    shell process, not just to the given command.

	  + An error in the format of these commands cause a  shell
	    script or function that contains them to abort.

	  + They cannot be overridden by shell functions.

       Other  commands	are  built-in  because	they  perform  side
       effects	on  the  current  environment  that would be nearly
       impossible to implement otherwise.  Built-ins such as cd and
       read  are  examples  of such built-ins.	These built-ins are


		      BELL LABORATORIES PROPRIETARY
       Not for use or disclosure outside Bell Laboratories except by
    written approval of the director of the distributing organization.











				  - 32 -



       semantically equivalent to commands that  are  not  built-in
       except that they don't take a path search to locate.

       A third reason to have a command built-in is so that it will
       be  unaffected  by  the	setting  of the PATH variable.	The
       print  command fits this category.  Scripts that  use  print
       will be portable to all sites that run ksh.

       The final reason for having a command be a built-in  is	for
       performance.   On  most	systems it is more than an order of
       magnitude faster to initiate a command that is built-in than
       to  create  a  separate process to run the command.  Example
       that fit this category are test and basename.

       Given a command name ksh decides what  it  means  using	the
       following order:

	  + Reserved words define commands that form  part  of	the
	    shell grammar.  They cannot be quoted.

	  + Alias substitutions occur first as part of the  reading
	    of	commands.   Using  quotes  in the command name will
	    prevent alias substitutions.

	  + Special built-ins come next.

	  + Functions.

	  + Commands that are built-in that are not associated with
	    a pathname.

	  + If the command name contains a /, the program or script
	    corresponding to the given name is executed.

	  + A path search locates the pathname corresponding to the
	    command.  If the pathname where it is found matches the
	    pathname  associated  with	a  built-in  command,	the
	    built-in  command  is executed.  If the directory where
	    the command is found is listed in the  FPATH  variable,
	    the  file is read into the shell like a dot script, and
	    a function by that name is invoked.  Once a pathname is
	    found,  ksh  remembers  its  location  and	only checks
	    relative directories in PATH the next time the  command
	    name  is used.  Assigning a value to PATH causes ksh to
	    forget the location of all command names.

				  - 33 -



	  + The FPATH variable is  searched  and  files  found	are
	    treated as described above.

       The  first  argument  of  the  command  built-in,  described
       earlier,  skips	the  checks  for  reserved  words  and	for
       function definitions.  In all other  ways,  command  behaves
       like  a built-in that is not associated with a pathname.  As
       a result, if the first argument	of  command  is  a  special
       built-in,  the  special	properties  of this built-in do not
       apply. For example, whereas, exec 3< foo will cause a script
       containing    it    to	 abort	  if	the   open   fails,
       command exec 3< foo results in a non-zero  exit	status	but
       does not abort the script.

       You can get a complete list of the special built-in commands
       with builtin -s. In addition builtin without arguments gives
       a list of the current built-ins and the pathname  that  they
       are  associated	with.	A  built-in can be bound to another
       pathname by giving  the	pathname  for  the  built-in.	The
       basename  of  this  path  must  be  the	name of an existing
       built-in for this to succeed.  Specifying the  name  of	the
       built-in without a pathname causes this built-in to be found
       before a path search.  On systems with run time	loading  of
       libraries,  built-in  commands can be added with the builtin
       command.  Each command  that  is  to  be  built-in  must  be
       written	as  a  C function whose name is of the form b_name,
       where name is the name of the built-in that is to be  added.
       The  function  has  the	same argument calling convention as
       main.  The lower eight bits of the return value	become	the
       exit  status  for  this	built-in.   Builtins  are  added by
       specifying the pathname of the library as an argument to the
       -f option of builtin.

       A built-in command, whence, when used with the -v option has
       been  provided  to  answer this question.  A line is printed
       for each argument to whence telling  what  would  happen  if
       this  argument  were  used as a command name.  It reports on
       reserved words, aliases, built-ins, and functions.   If	the
       command	is  none  of  the above, it follows the path search
       rules and prints the full path-name, if	any,  otherwise  it
       prints an error message.

       3.13  Symbolic Names

       To  avoid  implementation  dependencies,  ksh  accepts	and
       generates  symbolic  names  for built-ins that use numerical
       values in the Bourne shell.  The  -S  option  of  the  umask
       built-in  command accepts and displays default file creation
       permissions  symbolically.   It	uses  the   same   symbolic
       notation as the chmod command.

       The trap and kill built-in commands allows the signal  names
       to  be  given  symbolically.  The names of signals and traps
       corresponding to signals are the same  as  the  signal  name
       with the SIG prefix removed.  The trap 0 is named EXIT.

       3.14  Added Traps

       A new trap named ERR has been added.  This trap	is  invoked
       whenever  the  shell  would  exit if the -e option were set.
       This trap is used by Fourth Generation Make[16]	which  runs
       ksh as a co-process.

       A trap named DEBUG gets executed after each  command.   This
       trap can be used for debugging purposes.  The KEYBD trap was
       described earlier.

       3.15  Debugging

       The primary method for debugging Bourne shell scripts is  to
       use  the -x option to enable the execution trace.  After all
       the expansions have been performed, but before each  command
       is executed, the trace writes to standard error the name and
       arguments of each command preceded by a +.  With ksh the PS4
       variable  is  evaluated	for  parameter	substitution and is
       displayed before each command, instead of the +.

       The LINENO variable  is	set  to  the  current  line  number
       relative to the beginning of the current script or function.
       It is most useful as part of the PS4 prompt.

       The variable  RANDOM produces a random number in the range 0
       to  32767  each	time  it is referenced.  Assignment to this
       variable sets the seed for the random number generator.

       The parameter  PPID is used to generate the  process  id  of
       the process which invoked this shell.

       3.16  Timing Commands

       A reserved word time has been  added  to  replace  the  time
       command.   Any function, command or pipeline can be preceded
       by this	reserved  word	to  obtain  information  about	the
       elapsed,  user,	and  system  times.  Since I/O redirections
       bind to the command, not to time, parentheses should be used
       to redirect the timing information which is normally printed
       on file descriptor 2.


       4.  SECURITY

       There are several documented problems  associated  with	the
       security of  shell  procedures[17].   These  security  holes
       occur   primarily   because   a	 user  can  manipulate	the
       environment  to	subvert  the  intent  of  a  setuid   shell
       procedure.   Frequently, shell procedures are initiated from
       binary programs, without the author's awareness, by  library
       routines which invoke shells to carry out their tasks.  When
       the binary program is run setuid then  the  shell  procedure
       runs  with  the	permissions  afforded  to  the owner of the
       binary file.

       In the Bourne shell, the IFS parameter is used to split each
       word  into separate command arguments.  If a user knows that
       some setuid program will run sh -c /bin/pwd  (or  any  other
       command	in  /bin)  then  the  user  sets and exports IFS=/.
       Instead of running /bin/pwd the shell will run bin with	pwd
       as  an  argument.   The user puts his or her own bin program
       into the current directory.  This program can create a  copy
       of  the	shell,	make  this  shell  setuid, and then run the
       /bin/pwd program so that the original program  continues  to
       run  successfully.  This kind of penetration is not possible
       with ksh since the IFS parameter only splits arguments  that
       result from command or parameter substitution.

       Some setuid programs run  programs  using  system()  without
       giving  the  full  pathname.   If  the  user  sets  the PATH
       variable so that the desired command will be found in his or
       her  local  bin, then the same technique described above can
       be employed to compromise the security of  the  system.	 To
       close  up  this	and  other  security  holes, ksh resets the
       effective user id to the real  user  id	and  the  effective
       group  id  to the real group id unless the privileged option
       (-p)  is  specified  at	invocation.   In  this	mode,	the

       privileged   mode,  the	.profile  and  ENV  files  are	not
       processed.  Instead, the file /etc/suid_profile is read	and
       executed.   This  gives	an  administrator  control over the
       environment to set the PATH variable or to log setuid  shell
       invocations.   Clearly security of the system is compromised
       if /etc or this file is publicly writable.

       In the Berkeley UNIX version the operating system looks	for
       the  characters	#!   as  the  first  two  characters  of an
       executable file.  If these characters are  found,  then	the
       next word on this line is taken as the interpreter to invoke
       for this command and the interpreter is execed with the name
       of  the	script	as  argument zero and argument one.  If the
       setuid or setgid  bits  are  on	for  this  file,  then	the
       interpreter  is	run  with  the effective uid and/or gid set
       accordingly.  This scheme has two major drawbacks.  First of
       all,   using   the  #!	notation  forces  an  exec  of	the
       interpreter  even  when	the  call  is  invoked	 from	the
       interpreter  which  it must exec.  This is inefficient since
       the interpreter can handle a failed exec  much  faster  than
       starting  up  again.   More  importantly,  setuid and setgid
       procedures provide an easy target for intrusion.  By linking
       a  setuid  or  setgid procedure to a name beginning with a -
       the interpreter is fooled into thinking	that  it  is  being
       invoked with a command line option rather than the name of a
       file.  When the interpreter is the shell, the  user  gets  a
       privileged interactive shell.  There is code in ksh to guard
       against this simple form of intrusion.

       A more reliable way to handle setuid and  setgid  procedures
       is  provided  with  ksh.  The technique does not require any
       changes	to  the  operating  system  and   provides   better
       security.   Another advantage to this method is that it also
       allows scripts which have execute  permission  but  no  read
       permission  to  run.   Taking  away  read  permission  makes
       scripts more secure.

       The method relies on a setuid root program  to  authenticate
       the request and exec the shell with the correct mode bits to
       carry  out  the	task.	This  shell  is  invoked  with	the
       requested  file	already  open  for reading.  A script which
       cannot be opened for reading or which has its setuid  and/or
       setgid bits turned on causes this setuid root program to get
       execed.	For security reasons, this  program  is  given	the
       full   pathname	 /etc/suid_exec.    A  description  of	the
       implementation of the /etc/suid_exec program can be found in

       5.  CODE CHANGES

       ksh is written in ANSI-C as a reusable  library.   The  code
       can  be compiled with C++ and older K&R C as well.  The code
       uses the IEEE  POSIX  1003.1  and  ISO  9945-1  standard[19]
       wherever  possible  so that ksh should be able to run on any
       POSIX compliant system.	In  addition,  it  is  possible  to
       compile ksh for older systems.

       Unlike earlier version of the Bourne shell, ksh treats eight
       bit  characters	transparently  without	stripping  off	the
       leading bit.  There is also a compile time switch to  enable
       handling multi-byte and multi-width characters sets.

       On systems with dynamic libraries, it  is  possible  to	add
       built-in  commands  at  run  time  with the built-in command
       builtin described earlier.  It is also possible to embed ksh
       in applications in a manner analogous to tcl.


       6.  EXAMPLE

       An example of a ksh script  is  included  in  the  Appendix.
       This  one  page	program  is  a	variant  of the UNIX system
       grep(1) program.  Pattern matching for this version of  grep
       means shell patterns.

       The first half uses the getopts command to find	the  option
       flags.	Nearly	all  options  have  been  implemented.	The
       second half goes through each line of each file to look	for
       a pattern match.

       This program is not intended to serve as a  replacement	for
       grep  which  has been highly tuned for performance.  It does
       illustrate the programming  power  of  ksh.   Note  that  no
       auxiliary  processes  are  spawned  by  this script.  It was
       written and debugged in under two hours.  While	performance
       is acceptable for small files, this program runs at only one
       tenth the speed of grep for large files.

       7.  PERFORMANCE

       ksh executes many scripts faster than the  System  V  Bourne
       shell;  in  some  cases	more  than  10	times as fast.	The
       primary reason for this is that ksh creates fewer processes.
       The  time to execute a built-in command or a function is one
       or two orders of magnitude faster than performing  a  fork()
       and   exec()   to   create   a  separate  process.   Command
       substitution and commands inside parentheses  are  performed
       without	 creating  another  process,  unless  necessary  to
       preserve correct behavior.

       Another reason for improved performance is the  use  of	the
       sfio[20], library for I/O.  The sfio library buffers all I/O
       and  output and buffers are flushed only when required.	The
       algorithms used in  sfio  perform  better  than	traditional
       versions of standard I/O so that programs that spend most of
       their time formatting output  may  actually  perform  better
       than versions written in C.

       Several of the internal algorithms have been changed so that
       the  number  of	subroutine  calls  has	been  substantially
       reduced.  ksh uses variable sized hash tables for variables.
       Scripts	that  rely heavily on referencing variables execute
       faster.	More processing  is  performed	while  reading	the
       script  so that execution time is saved while running loops.
       These changes are not noticeable for scripts that fork() and
       run  processes,	but  they  reduce the time that it takes to
       interpret commands by more than a factor of two.

       Most  importantly,   ksh   provide   mechanisms	 to   write
       applications  that  do  not  require as many processes.	The
       arithmetic provided by the shell eliminates the need for the
       expr   command.	  The	pattern   matching   and  substring
       capabilities eliminate the need to use sed or awk to process
       strings.

       The architecture of ksh	makes  it  easy  to  make  commands
       built-ins  without  changing  the semantics at all.  Systems
       that have run-time binding of libraries	allow  applications
       to  be  sped  up by supplying the critical programs as shell
       built-in commands.  Implementations on other systems can add
       built-in commands at compile time.

       8.  CONCLUSION

       The 1988 version of ksh has tens  of  thousands	of  regular
       users  and  is  a suitable replacement for the Bourne shell.
       The 1993 version of ksh	is  essentially  upward  compatible
       with  both  the 1988 version of ksh and with the recent IEEE
       POSIX and ISO shell standard.  The 1993 version offers  many
       advantages  for	programming  applications,  and it has been
       rewritten so that it can be used in  embedded  applications.
       It also offers improved performance.
