    ==============================================================
        The files in this subdirectory are to demonstrate a
        variety of Workspace Manager and menu configurations. 

        vertical.rc    - contains dtwm configuration information for
                         a vertical front panel.

        vertical.defs  - contains resource definitions for the above.

        box.rc         - contains dtwm configuration information for
                         a multi-row, compact front panel.

        box.defs       - contains resource definitions for the above.

        Before experimenting, you may wish to save your current
        environment so that you can restore it later.

        1.  Press the Style Manager button in the front panel
            to start the Style Manager (the button in the bottom
            row that looks like a color palette).

        2.  Press the "Startup" button in the Style Manager to
            access the "Session Startup" window.

        3.  Press the "Ask me at Logout" button so that you
            have a choice before logging out.

        4.  Press the "Set Home Session" button to save your
            current settings as your home session.
         
        5.  Press the "OK" button to continue the operation.

        6.  When the hourglass pointer disappears, the operation
            is completed.  Press the "OK" button to dismiss the 
            "Session Startup" window.

        After saving your home session, you can begin experimenting:

        1.  Merge the desired 'defs' file into your display environment.
            For example:

                xrdb -merge vertical.defs

        2. Check to see if you have a file called 'dtwmrc' in your
           .dt directory. If so, save it.

           ls $HOME/.dt
           cp $HOME/.dt/dtwmrc $HOME/.dt/dtwmrc.sav

        3. Copy the 'rc' file into your .dt directory, renaming it
           'dtwmrc'. For example:

                cp vertical.rc $HOME/.dt/dtwmrc

        4.  Restart dtwm:

                With the pointer over the workspace background,
                press mouse button 1 to display the Workspace Menu.

                Select "Restart Dtwm..." from the Workspace Menu.
        
        5. To restore your original environment:

           a. Remove the dtwmrc file, and copy back the original, if
              you saved one.

               rm $HOME/.dt/dtwmrc
               cp $HOME/.dt/dtwmrc.sav $HOME/.dt/dtwmrc

           b. Log out and log back in again using the Home Session
              you saved:

              - Move the pointer to the front panel and press the
                Exit button (the button that has the busy light).

              - Select "Restore Home" from the "Logout Confirmation"
                window.

              - Log back in again.

        6. To save one of these Workspace Managers as your own, simply
           select "Restart Current" when you log out instead of
           "Restore Home".

            Note:  
            ------
            You may want to change back to your original Style
            Manager startup configuration by selecting "Resume current
            session" from the Startup dialog.
