helpgen is a non-Motif (terminal based) application. It creates three files,
<filename>.hv, <filename>00.ht and <filename>01.ht in the target directory.
The default target directory is '/usr/dt/help/<language>/Browser'. The
default <filename> is 'browser'.

1)  To get the usage message, type
	helpgen -help

    tests message:
	Set 1  _DtMessage: 1

2)  Specify a name using the -dir option that is not a directory. To do
    this, create a file in the /tmp directory, then use it as if it were
    a directory. For example, type:

	touch /tmp/testdir
	helpgen -dir /tmp/testdir/testfile

    Remove /tmp/testdir when finished.

    tests message:
	Set 1  _DtMessage: 2

3)  Attempt to write to a directory that only the super-user (system
    administrator)  has permission to write to. To do this, check that
    the directory /usr/vhelp/help exists and that write permission is
    denied for the average user. For example, type:

	ll -d /usr/vhelp/help.

    If the permission shown do not allow the average user access, continue.
    Otherwise, change them to disallow access or create and/or use another
    directory that does not allow the average user access.

    Upon finding a suitable directory for testing, type the following (this
    example assumes /usr/vhelp/help is being used):

	helpgen -dir /usr/vhelp/help/testdir.

    tests message:
	Set 1  _DtMessage: 3

4)  Specify a name using the -dir option that is not a directory. To do
    this, create a file in the /tmp directory, then use it as if it were
    a directory. For example, type:

	touch /tmp/testdir
	helpgen -dir /tmp/testdir

    Remove /tmp/testdir when finished.

    tests message:
	Set 1  _DtMessage: 6

5)  Attempt to overwrite an existing read-only browser volume. To do this,
    check the permissions on the files in the directory
    /usr/dt/help/C/Browser. If the permissions allow the average user
    to access these files, change the permissions to allow only the
    super-user access. Type:

	helpgen

    tests message:
	Set 1  _DtMessage: 8

6)  Create a browser volume in a read-only directory. To do this, create
    a directory without write permission. For example, type:

	mkdir /tmp/testdir
	chmod -w /tmp/testdir

    Now use the read-only directory as the parameter to the -dir option:

	helpgen -dir /tmp/testdir

    Remove /tmp/testdir when finished.

    tests message:
	Set 1  _DtMessage: 9

7)  Copy a family file to a work directory. Edit the file and remove
    the 'title' resource from the file. Symbolically link this file
    to the directory /usr/vhelp/families/<language>. Type:

	helpgen -dir /tmp

    Remove the symbolic link in /usr/vhelp/families/<language> and
    the browser volumes in /tmp when done.

    tests message:
	Set 1  _DtMessage: 11

8)  Copy a family file to a work directory. Edit the file and remove
    the 'abstract' resource from the file. Symbolically link this file
    to the directory /usr/vhelp/families/<language>. Type:

	helpgen -dir /tmp

    Remove the symbolic link in /usr/vhelp/families/<language> and
    the browser volumes in /tmp when done.

    tests message:
	Set 1  _DtMessage: 12

9)  Copy a family file to a work directory. Edit the file and remove
    the 'volumes' resource from the file. Symbolically link this file
    to the directory /usr/vhelp/families/<language>. Type:

	helpgen -dir /tmp

    Remove the symbolic link in /usr/vhelp/families/<language> and
    the browser volumes in /tmp when done.

    tests message:
	Set 1  _DtMessage: 13

10) Copy a family file to a work directory. Edit the file and remove
    the 'charSet' resource from the file. Symbolically link this file
    to the directory /usr/vhelp/families/<language>. Type:

	helpgen -dir /tmp

    Remove the symbolic link in /usr/vhelp/families/<language> and
    the browser volumes in /tmp when done.

    tests message:
	Set 1  _DtMessage: 14

11) Move the directory /usr/vhelp/familes to /usr/vhelp/familes.save.
    NOTE: This requires the user to be super-user.
    Type:

	helpgen -dir /tmp

    Restore the families directory by moving /usr/vhelp/families.save
    to /usr/vhelp/families.

    tests message:
	Set 1  _DtMessage: 16

12) Move the directory /usr/vhelp/volumes to /usr/vhelp/volumes.save.
    NOTE: This requires the user to be super-user.
    Type:

	helpgen -dir /tmp

    Restore the families directory by moving /usr/vhelp/volumes.save
    to /usr/vhelp/volumes.

    tests message:
	Set 1  _DtMessage: 17

13) Run helpgen as super-user. Run helpview. The application helpview,
    can either be run from a terminal window or by selecting the icon on
    the front panel showing books with a question mark over them. The
    window that displays should show the browser volume created by helpgen.

    The text localized in set 2 messages 2 through 4 should be displayed
    at the top of the window. The text between the <ABBREV> tags in
    set 2 message 3 will be displayed in the topic hierarchy. The last
    hypertext link (underlined titles) should be from set 2 message 5.

    The text will use the fonts associated with the character set
    specified in set 2 message 1. Check that the app-defaults file
    for helpview contains a font set associated with the character
    set specified.
