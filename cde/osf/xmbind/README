This directory contains the xmbind client.

xmbind is used to set up the bindings between keys on the
keyboard and Motif virtual keys.

Normally mwm will do this on initialization. If you are not
running mwm, or wish to change the bindings without restarting
mwm, use xmbind.

For more information see the xmbind and VirtualBindings man pages.
