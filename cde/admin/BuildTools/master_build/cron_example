# Description:  This file is an example cron script which triggers
#    builds and does normal tree maintenance. The various functions
#    are delimited by the letters #[A-Z]).
#    A) fnrclone can leave 2 files each time it executes:
#       The file ${HOME}/fnrclone/log.hhmmss and script.hhmmss.
#       These files can pile up and they are cleaned out by the cleanfnr
#       script. 
#       NOTE: In the very near future this will not be the default
#       operation for fnrclone and this may  no longer be necessary.
#    B) By default, master_build puts its log files in the 
#       /x/logs/build/MMDD/${buildtreename} directory. The
#       cleanLogs script trims these directories.
#    C) The script ListTheTree creates a listing of all of the files in
#       a tree and puts the list under the name :TreeListing in the top
#       of the tree.
#    D) An example of building the /x/cde_hp700_90 tree on the
#       machine that is doing cron.
#    E) An example of building the /x/cde_hp700d_90(debug) tree on a 
#       remote machine using remsh.

#A) clean ${HOME}/fnrclone directory
4 11 * * * /x/cdesrc/admin/BuildTools/master_build/cleanfnr 1>/users/marca/xbuild/cleanfnr.log 2>&1

#B) clean excess build logs in /x/logs/build
4 19 * * * /x/cdesrc/admin/BuildTools/master_build/cleanLogs 1>/x/logs/cronlogs/cleanLogs.log 2>&1

#C) create a listing of the files in a tree and put into top of the tree.
#   this also creates a listing of locked files
10 12 * * * /x/cdesrc/admin/BuildTools/master_build/ListTheTree /x/cdesrc 1>/x/logs/cronlogs/ListTheTreecdesrc.log 2>&1

#D) build the hp tree putting the log files in the default location.
#   the source tree is /x/cdesrc; the build tree is /x/cde_hp700_90.
#   This entry will first do an fnrclone -s /x/cdesrc /x/cde_hp700_90
#      to sync up the build tree's links to the source (-clone s).
#      The log and error files from the clone will go into
#      /x/logs/build/mmdd/cde_hp700_90/clonelog.HHMMSS
#      /x/logs/build/mmdd/cde_hp700_90/cloneerr.HHMMSS
#   It uses -c to do all of the normal imake functions:
#     make -i Makefile; make -i Makefiles;make -i includes;make -i
#     depend and make -i.
#     The log files for make -i will go in
#     /x/logs/build/mmdd/cde_hp700_90/make.HHMMSS.
#     The log files for all other operations will go in
#     /x/logs/build/mmdd/cde_hp700_90/allmake.HHMMSS.
#   The second entry uses -w to "clean the tree": remove all .o's, .a's, 
#     executables etc.  Normally we make clean once a week on Saturday night.
#   The -cl option will remove symbolic links to nowhere.
#   The -m option will mail notification to someone when the build
#     is complete.
