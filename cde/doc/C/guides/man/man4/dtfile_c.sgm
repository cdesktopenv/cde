<Title>DESCRIPTION</Title>
<Para>The File Manager properties dialog can be used to change Unix file
attributes. It can also be configured to allow editing of additional,
filesystem-specific, attributes (such as Access Control Lists in AFS
file systems). This ability is currently limited to IBM, Sun, and HP
systems.
</Para>
<Para>Whenever the properties dialog is invoked, File Manager identifies the
type of filesystem using platform-dependent library functions. For AIX
the st_vfstype field returned by stat is used, for HPUX the f_fsid[1]
field returned by statfs is used, and for SUNOS the f_basetype field
returned by statvfs is used. The contents of this field is combined
with the name of the system to create an identifier for the filesystem
(e.g. aix:3). File Manager reads a configuration file (see below for
file format) looking for this compound identifier. If it is not found,
no further action is taken. Any errors which occur while reading the
configuration file are logged in $HOME/.dt/errorlog.
</Para>
<Para>If found, the platform-dependent identifier is mapped to a
platform-independent form (e.g. native). For each platform-independent
identifier, the configuration file provides the name of a program which
can be used to edit filesystem-specific properties. In addition, it
give a label that is used on a button which is added to the properties
dialog. When the button is pressed, File Manager forks a process to
execute the program. While the filesystem-specific dialog appears to
the user to be part of File Manager, it is implemented as a top-level
shell and can be executed from the command line. File Manager provides
only a single argument to the program: the complete path of the file.
An option is also provided for the normal properties dialog to be
Cancelled when the file-system specific dialog is invoked. Note that
this will cause any changes made in the normal properties dialog to be
lost.
</Para>
<Para>The platform-dependent identifier can also be used to present a message
in the properties dialog. This message can appear either on its own or
in conjunction with a pushbutton and properties dialog program as
described above.
</Para>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Location of configuration file</Title>
<Para>File Manager looks in three places for the configuration file, stopping
the search once the file is found. The three locations, in search order,
are $HOME/dtfile.config (user-specific configuraton),
/etc/dt/config/dtfile.config (customized system configuration) and
/usr/dt/config/$LANG/dtfile.config (factory defaults). If none of these
is found, an error message indicating that /usr/dt/config/$LANG/dtfile.config
cannot be found is placed in $HOME/.dt/errorlog. For debugging, File
Manager will use a configuration file defined in the environment
variable DTFSCONFIG before searching any of the other locations.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Format of configuration file</Title>
<Para>The File Manager configuration file consists of two sections. The first
section maps platform-specific information to a platform-independent
identifier. There are two fields in the platform-specific portion
separated by a colon. The first field identifies the platform: aix,
hpux, sunos. The second field depends on platform; for aix it is an
integer corresponding to the st_vfstype field returned by stat, for hpux
it is an integer corresponding to the f_fsid[1] field returned by
statfs, for sunos it is a string corresponding to the f_basetype field
returned by statvfs. The platform-independent identifier is given
following an equals sign. The keyword "end" delimits the list of
mappings. For example, to define the "native" file systems on several
platforms:
</Para>
<ProgramListing>aix:3 = native
hpux:0 = native
sunos:ufs = native
end
</ProgramListing>
<Para>The second section of the configuration file provides information needed
by File Manager to execute the filesystem-specific dialog. It consists
of a list of platform-independent identifiers followed by a colon and
several fields. Each field consists of a name followed by an equals sign
and a string. The five field names are: buttonLabel, which defines a
label for a button in the permissions dialog; fsDialog, which defines
the path to the program which displays the dialog for editing
file-specific properties; warning, which is optional and defines a
warning message to be displayed in permissions dialog; and dismiss,
which is optional, and specifies if the normal properties dialog is to
be cancelled when the file-system specific dialog is invoked. Dismiss
can be set to either "yes" or "no" and defaults to "no". "\n" can be
included in the warning text to generate a new line. Continuing the
native file system example used above, the following would enable a
file-system specific dialog generated by the program
/local/bin/modExtAttr:
</Para>
<ProgramListing>native: buttonLabel = Modify extended attributes ...
        warning     = Warning:\nExtended attributes may limit your access
        fsDialog    = /local/bin/modExtAttr
        dismiss     = yes
</ProgramListing>
</RefSect2>
</RefSect1>

<Title>SEE</Title>
<Para>The factory-default configuration file,
/usr/dt/config/$LANG/dtfile.config, contains further examples. Included
are some test examples that can be enabled by removing comment
characters from the definition lines in the file. Also included are
defaults for AFS file systems which cause a warning message to be added
to the regular properties dialog, but no dialog is provided.
