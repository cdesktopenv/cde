<RefPurpose>
Introduces the DtSearch text search and retrieval system
</RefPurpose>
</RefNameDiv>
<RefSect1>
<Title>DESCRIPTION</Title>
<Para>DtSearch is a general purpose text search and retrieval system that
serves as the text search engine for the DtInfo browser in the Common
Desktop Environment (CDE). DtSearch utilizes a full text inverted index
of natural language words and stems. Both queries and documents have
been internationalized for CDE single- and multi-byte languages, with
provision for the definition of custom languages. Queries are simple
text strings that can optionally include full boolean specifications
with a simple intuitive syntax. Results of searches can be ranked
statistically. Document retrievals can include information for
highlighting query words in retrieved documents.
</Para>
<Para>DtSearch consists of two major functional areas.
The first is a set of offline build tools that:
</Para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<Para>Create searchable databases.
</Para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<Para>Index the user's text files and load the resultant search
information into the databases.
</Para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<Para>Maintain the databases.
</Para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<Para>The second functional area is an online search API. It provides a simple
interface to the search engine to facilitate user-written search and
retrieval programs. The API consists of a set of functions compiled into
the library <filename>libDtSearch</filename>, with function prototypes,
constant definitions, and data structures defined in
<filename>Search.h</filename>. DtSearch includes a sample browser source
program, <filename>dtsrtest.c</filename>, to demonstrate API usage.
</Para>
<Para>Information and error messages in both functional areas, including those
appended to the online API MessageList, are generated from a single
DtSearch Message catalog, <filename>dtsearch.cat</filename>. The source
for this catalog is <filename>dtsearch.msg</filename>.
</Para>
<Para>Each DtSearch database is associated with a single full text inverted
index. In addition, each database can be partitioned into logical
subsets of documents called "keytypes" by a naming convention of the
database keys. The search engine can open multiple databases and users
can specify any combination of databases and keytypes for each query,
thus providing a two tier search capability. Users can further qualify
searches by restricting the search return list by date ranges and
maximum number of documents returned.
</Para>
<Para>DtSearch is written in ANSI Standard and POSIX compliant C. The DtSearch
online search API is not reentrant (not "thread-safe") and must
therefore be directly linked into the user-written search program. The
DtSearch API will increase the size of a browser search program from
100K to 200K bytes depending on which functions are called.
</Para>
</RefSect1>
<RefSect1>
<Title>GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS AND CONVENTIONS</Title>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Database Names</Title>
<para>Databases consist of a set of binary and ASCII files whose names are the
1- to 8-character ASCII database name specified to the
<command>dtsrcreate</command> command, a period (.), and a 1- to
3-character ASCII file name suffix. Executing
<command>dtsrcreate</command> will create and initialize these files.
After creation, databases are always identified by the 1- to 8-character
name string used in <command>dtsrcreate</command>. The database names
<literal>dtsearch</literal> and <literal>austext</literal> are reserved
and may not be specified.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>DtSearch Languages</Title>
<para>Each database is associated with a single natural language. Unlike
conventional locales, a DtSearch language includes code set presumptions
and, most importantly, linguistic parsing and stemming rules to identify
indexable terms in a text stream. A DtSearch language is specified when
a database is created. Developers can also define custom languages with
special code sets and linguistic rules. See "Language Parsing and
Stemming" in this man page below for details.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Database Types</Title>
<para>The API can be used simply as a search engine, referring to documents
only through the inverted indexes. Alternatively, a database can be
configured to store actual document text in compressed format in a
repository efficiently accessible to the engine. The configuration
options that indicate these alternatives are referred to as database
types and are specified to <command>dtsrcreate</command> at database
creation time.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Abstracts</Title>
<para>A field called the "abstract" is included in the fzk file for each
document loaded into a database, and is included on the Results list for
each document in a successful search. When documents are not stored in a
repository, the abstract typically specifies a file name, URL, or other
reference useful to the browser. It can also include summary information
viewable by users to help them select documents for retrieval and
display.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Offline Build Tools</Title>
<para><command>dtsrcreate</command> creates and initializes new databases or
reinitializes preexisting databases. Textual data is loaded into
databases by the execution of two programs. <command>dtsrload</command>
creates a database object record for each text document, and
<command>dtsrindex</command> creates the full text inverted index of
words and stems for each object record. Based on unique database keys
for each object, <command>dtsrload</command> and
<command>dtsrindex</command> can also serve as update programs for
preexisting databases.
</Para>
<para>The input to the load and index programs is a canonical text file with a
<Filename>.fzk</Filename> file name suffix. The format of fzk files is
sufficiently simple that they can be generated manually. In addition,
DtSearch includes a utility program, <command>dtsrhan</command>, which
can generate a correctly formatted fzk file for some kinds of text
documents.
</Para>
<para>Several other utilites provided in the distribution package are suitable
for extracting summary database information, including
<command>dtsrdbrec</command> and <command>dtsrkdump</command>.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Argument Conventions</Title>
<para>Optional command line arguments are specified with a dash (&minus;) and
typically a single character argument identifier. Some required
arguments also use the dash convention. Unless specifically indicated
otherwise, dash arguments may be specified in any order. Where values
are used with dash arguments, they must be directly appended to the
argument without white space.
</Para>
<para>Optional arguments precede required arguments. Non-dash required
arguments must usually be specified in the order indicated by the usage
statement.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
</RefSect1>
<RefSect1>
<Title>LANGUAGE PARSING AND STEMMING</Title>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Parsing and Stemming</Title>
<para>Word parsing is fundamental to DtSearch operations at both index time
and query time. Linguistic parsing algorithms filter incoming text
strings into sequences of word tokens for each natural language.
Depending on the language, word tokens may also be processed into stem
tokens. At index time each linguistic token, or term, in a document is
stored in the inverted index. At search time queries are parsed for
linguistic terms and used to access the documents that contain them.
</Para>
<para>Each database is assigned its own DtSearch language identified by a
language number at database creation time. A language number determines
the parsing and stemming algorithms to be applied to the database's text
and queries. Internal DtSearch algorithms are supplied for supported
languages including several European languages and Japanese. In addition
a user exit mechanism permits developers to provide their own custom
language algorithms for a database.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Language Files</Title>
<para>Language algorithms often use various word lists. Typically, these lists
are stored in language files for easy maintenance, with the type of list
identified by the file name extension. Language files are opened and
read into internal tables when the offline programs initialize or when
the <function>DtSearchInit</function> online API function is called. Some
language files are required and initialization will return fatal errors
if they are missing. Some language files are optional and associated
algorithms will be silently bypassed if they are missing. Files for
supported languages may be edited to provide database specific
enhancements. At open time, database specific files supersede generic
language files.
</Para>
</RefSect2>

<Title>General European Parsing Rules</Title>
<para>The currently supported European languages are

</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>
<para>If not otherwise specified, <command>dtscreate</command> will initialize
databases with language number 0. Note that all supported European
languages use a single-byte encoding method, with the ASCII code set as
a proper subset.
</Para>
<para>Parsed text, including both queries and indexed text in documents,
is case insensitive in supported European languages.
</Para>
<para>In supported European languages parsing is accomplished with the Teskey
algorithm, which partitions a character set into characters that are
always parts of words (concordable), characters that are never parts of
words (nonconcordable), and characters that may be parts of words
depending on context (optionally concordable). Typically, alphanumeric
characters are concordable. Whitespace and most punctuation is
nonconcordable. Slashes are examples of characters that may or may not
separate words depending on context. The essence of the parsing
algorithm is "optionally concordable characters preceding concordable
characters are concordable; otherwise, they are nonconcordable". For
example, UNIX directory names of the form
<filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> would be considered just one word,
but slashes in isolation would be discarded as nonconcordable.
</Para>
<para>The parsing algorithm does a table lookup to determine the
concordability of characters. The tables are arrays of the characters
for each code page supported by the algorithm. Currently 7-bit ASCII and
ISO Latin-1 are supported.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Words Not Indexed</Title>
<para>Several additional parsing rules are applied to prevent indexing
meaningless terms. These terms include common prepositions, indefinite
articles, and nonlinguistic text strings such as formatting tags,
sequences of hexadecimal dump characters, list identifiers, etc.
</Para>
<para>Tokens whose lengths are less than a minimum word size or greater than a
maximum word size are discarded. The default minimum and maximum word
sizes can be overridden in <command>dtsrcreate</command>.
</Para>
<para>Similarly words found in the "stop list" file for the database are
discarded. Stop lists are external, editable language files. Each
supported European language is provided with a default stop list.
</Para>
<para>Words found in an "include list" file are forcibly indexed even if they
would otherwise be discarded. Include list database files are optional;
no defaults are provided.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Stemming</Title>
<para>When specified for a language, individual parsed words will be
"conflated" or mapped into their "stem" form, a new word that represents
the etymological root of the original word. A default null stemming
algorithm is used for languages that are not otherwise provided with a
supported stemmer. The null stemmer returns the original word as its own
stem. Both words and stems are stored in the inverted index. API
searches can be specified for either words or stems, but the two search
methods are distinguished only when real stems have been stored in the
inverted index.
</Para>
<para>In the supported European languages stemming can be accomplished
heuristically or by dictionary lookup. The heuristic algorithms
typically remove affixes in a language-dependent way. Affix lists are
usually stored in language files. Currently stemming is supported
for English languages 0 and 1, Spanish language 2, French language 3,
Italian language 4, and German language 5.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Japanese</Title>
<para>Two Japanese DtSearch languages (numbers 6 and 7) are supported. Both
use the same packed, Extended UNIX Code (EUC) character set. The two
languages differ only in the technique used to parse compound kanji
words. All validly encoded text for supported Japanese languages
incorporates ASCII encoding as a proper, single-byte subset. The
supported Japanese languages use the null stemmer.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Kanji Compounds</Title>
<para>Individual kanji characters are parsed as single words. In addition, for
language number 6 all possible kanji substrings (pairs, triplets, etc.)
found in any contiguous string of kanjis will be parsed as compound
kanji words, up to a maximum word size of 6 kanji characters. For
language number 7, only kanji substrings listed in the
<filename>jpn.knj</filename> language file may be treated as compound
kanji words. At offline index time all possible individual kanjis and
kanji compounds for a language are stored in the inverted index. At
online search time kanji substrings in the query are treated as single
query terms and are not compounded further.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Japanese Code Sets</Title>
<para>The supported packed EUC character set consists of four separate
multibyte Code Sets. Code Set 0 can be either 7-bit ASCII or 7-bit
JIS-Roman. The first and only byte of a character in Code Set 0 is less
than 0x80. Substrings of Code Set 0 in supported Japanese text are
parsed into individual words with the European language parser described
above. Minimum and maximum word sizes, stop lists, and include lists
will be used as in European languages if provided with a Japanese
database.
</Para>
<para>Code Set 1 is JIS X 0208-1990. The two-byte characters in Code Set 1
always begin with a byte greater than 0xA0 and less than 0xFF. Symbols
and line drawing elements are not indexed. Hirigana strings are
discarded as equivalent to stop list words. Contiguous substrings of
katakana, Roman, Greek, or cyrillic are parsed as single words.
Individual kanji characters are treated as single words with additional
kanji compounding depending on language number, as described above.
Characters from unassigned kuten rows are treated as user-defined kanji.
</Para>
<para>Code Set 2 is halfwidth katakana. The two-byte characters in Code Set 2
always begin with the unique byte 0x8E. Contiguous strings are parsed as
single words.
</Para>
<para>Code Set 3 is JIS X 0212-1990. The three-byte characters in Code Set 3
always begin with the unique byte 0x8F. Parsing is similar to Code Set
1: discard symbols, etc., contiguous strings of related foreign
characters equal words, and individual kanjis and unassigned characters
equal single words, with additional kanji compounding depending on
language. Kuten row 5 is treated as katakana; undefined rows are treated
as kanji.
</Para>
</RefSect2>
<RefSect2>
<Title>Custom Languages</Title>
<para>All language dependent data structures and functions are referenced by
fields in the main internal DtSearch structure for databases (DBLK). The
same structure is used for offline build programs as well as online API
search functions. Language processing is initialized database by
database by an internal language loader function which stores values in
DBLK fields. A database whose language number is not supported is
presumed to be associated with a custom language. A special function,
<Function>load_custom_language</Function>, is called to initialize
language fields for custom languages. The default
<Function>load_custom_language</Function> merely returns an error code.
However, developers can link in their own
<Function>load_custom_language</Function> function, which will be called
to initialize the DBLK fields needed to parse and stem one or more
custom languages. Values required for the language fields of a DBLK are
specified in &cdeman.DtSrAPI;.
